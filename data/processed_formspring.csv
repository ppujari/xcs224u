Once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the bar.r r The bartender can't hold back his curiosity any longer. &quot;Excuse me  sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?&quot;r r &quot;Well &quot; says the man  &quot;several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found this old lamp.

Whether it's a gallon of milk  or a Rolls Royce  the exact money is always there &quot; says the man.r r &quot;That's fantastic!&quot; says the bartender. &quot;You are a genius! ...

Is 'Innocents and Alleys  don't they ever learn' better or not as good as 'I'm being stalked by psycho killers and I hide in the shower'?, I have no idea lol! All the episodes of charmed kind of bleed into one :P They are all good though  and Charmed  Buffy  Angel  Skins etc etc are like one long TV show  I don't really think of them as individual eps :),Positive

8623,and yea  I will join the preach LOL, Good good good. I will let you know dates and the basic script of shouting...I MEAN PREACHING :P,Positive
8624,answering or asking (must pick one)?, Asking :) Probably because I like to find out things about certain people ;) buttttttttt its hard when you can't think of anything to ask  and you end up coming across like a babbling idiot ;),Positive
8625,Any piercings? If yes  how many and where are they? And do you want more?, Only my lobes. I want to get a few more done on my ears  just regular ones going up and a scaffold piercing on my right ear  BUT I don't like needles.

8630,Are eyebrows considered facial hair?, HAHA! I guess they are! SO  does that mean when we're playing the game &quot;Guess who?&quot; and you say &quot;Does he have facial hair?&quot; the answer would always be &quot;yes&quot; lol. Unless they are facially bald :/,Positive

8634,Are you a heavy or light sleeper?, Definitely a light sleeper. I wake up at the smallest thing  and its crap because I have problems sleeping anyway  so it results in very littttttle sleep :(,Positive
8635,Are you a morning person?, Not really. Again  because of my insomnia  when I get up  im usually pretty tired  but I tend to snap out of it as time goes on.

Everything would be boring :( Just the usual kind of stuff  I guess its called trying your luck? lol,Positive
8639,are you a squeamish person? (like around blood and guts and stuff)?, Im not to an extent. I have never seen anything really squeamish in real life  so I only have to base it on TV things. I can watch most things  but there are odd (about 3 times in my life) where I have actually had to look away. A scene from Pathology being one :S Saw 3 being another and The Descent 2 being the last :),Positive
8640,Are you a task oriented person or a people oriented person?, I don't think I really understand that question o_O,Positive
8641,are you a vegetarian? :-, Im not no  but I could quite easily give up meat. I do agree with vegetarianism but because I still live with my family  its difficult to live like it :(,Positive
8642,are you at all double-jointed? at all flexible?, Not really no lol. Are you?,Positive

8650,Are you good at making new friends?, I think im pretty good at making friends  yeah definitely  but I'm not great at making those really close friends you know? I can make friends  that i pass time with  but I wouldn't consider them life changing or that special to me.,Positive
8651,Are you good at making people smile?... other than me of course ;-), I try to :) I don't know if I am  but the approach I usually take (in person) is the stupid one lol. I can be really really stupid if  want to be  not like slapstick  I just make stupid comments that generally make people laugh. So  I hope so :) I think you're going to have to ask them  but it is my intention. Unless im pissed off with them  then they don't deserve to be smiling at me lol.,Positive

8659,Are you old enough to vote in your country? What is the voting age? Did you vote at the last election?

I voted for the labour party in the local election last year  and im pretty sure they won  but again  I don't really keep up on politics :P,Positive
8660,Are you old fashioned in any way?, Only traditional in the romantic sense :P lol As in  I believe people shouldn't get married unless terribly in love (and not because of arranges or because of children etc)  and to treat your guy/girl with respect and never let them down etc etc etc You know where im going with this lol.,Positive

8664,are you the type of person who would be the one to make the 'first move'? relationship-wise/crush-wise..?, It depends really.

If I knew they did  then I could potentially yes  it all depends on the moment and things :),Positive
8665,Are you ticklish? are you VERY ticklish  or just kind of  or not at all? if so where are you most ticklish? are you ticklish in other areas? :-) haha, Hmmm  I am pretty ticklish yes :P Down the sides of my stomach I am VERY VERY VERY ticklish!

8673,at the wedding  who would wear the tux and who would wear the dress? Or would you both wear a dress (or a tux)?, HAHA! Well  Im not a lover of the Over the top dresses  so I would want to wear a dress  but a kind of plain-ish one  and my fiance could wear whatever they wanted to wear. As long as they were happy  I would be happy :),Positive
8674,At what point are we good enough? When are we self-improved enough to accept ourselves?, We are always good enough. To strive for something that may or may not happen  it means you are pretty likely to be disappointed by the results. All in all  don't try to change  you would never be disappointed  and would even be happier with something that you MAY have always wanted. Who knows :),Positive
8675,attempt to define normal?, I don't think they is really such thing as normal. But if I was to attempt to define it  then &quot;Normal could be defined as something that is socially acceptable  and would be considered 'the norm'.

8682,Because she is 100% straight  and i know for a fact  because all she ever talks about is boys etc... |-)!  i've liked her since last year :(!, Ohhh I see :( The straight issue. Yeah  we have all been there  it happens to the best of us. With straight people  its not healthy to get hung up on them  so I can see why you want to get it out of your system. Talking through it can help  plus concentrating your feelings on something else can help :) Aka  keeping distracted lol. Literally  try not to think of her like that too. You know?

I don't have much confidence so when I have been drinking (not loads) just enough to increase my confidence a bit :) Bars  I find a bit....slow? lol Also  going to a club with a partner (not that I have recently  or ever properly :S) but its a nice feeling :) More so than a bar I think :),Positive
8740,cn u post a lnk to ur LJ fanfic?????, I can... http://kellyblake1.livejournal.com/1641.html There are about 20+ chapters  so continue through my journal to read if you wish :),Positive
8741,cold or hot vacation (with a lover)?? ;-), haha! With a lover  ummmm. Completely depends on where we were going  I mean  somewhere known for activities in a cold climate  then cold. I mean  how long can you actually spend on a beach or sunbathing? Its boriiiiiiiiing lol.,Positive

8749,dark or light nail polish?, Dark  even though its the hardest to keep on top of  I think dark nails can look gorgeousssss :D,Positive

8751,describe yo perfecto woman., Can I do a Skins relation? lol Emily :) She is  to me  the PERFECT girlfriend! Yeah  she can sometimes be a little much or suffocating  but its only because she cares about the girl that she loves. As for looks  I don't really date someone based on their looks. Its about personality for me. Obviously I need that initial attraction  but I don't have a 'type' as such to fall for :),Positive
8752,describe your best kiss?, Best kiss? You mean as in my kissing style?  Well I prefer kind of sensual kisses? As in (I can't believe I am describing my kissing style LOL) slower and meaningful ones? Obviously to keep a relationship alive then it needs to be varied but Im not a big fan of kisses where the other person sticks their tongue down your throat :S Especially if its really forceful and you aren't in 'that' kind of mood. You know what I mean? :S How about you anyway? :P This was an awkward question  im returning it :P,Positive
8753,Describe your fighting style: drunken master or angry monkey?, Druken Master ;) I am a pro at my fights ;) HAHA,Positive

Well you would have to just wait and see ;) HAHA I can't believe I just wrote that! I don't know really  I mean I have never really made it  so I suppose  a pout and a wink with a nice snarl ;) haha. Joking again :P Ummm  I dunno really. It would vary from time to time :) How about yours?,Positive
8756,describe... your favorite necklace? (p.s.> i could think of sooo many dirty things to put after the describe part... but i wont) ;-) haha, HAHA! Go for it if you really want to ;) lol I don't mind answering :P My favourite necklace? Ummm  I don't know if I really have one if im honest. Im one of those people who would like to own a lot of something (eg jewellery) than have one really expensive item. I do have one necklace that I REALLY love! Its from Urban Outfitters  and its a little gold envelope  that has a letter inside saying &quot;Cest La Vie&quot; meaning &quot;This is life&quot; or &quot;That's life&quot; in French :),Positive
8757,describe... your first intimate experience (:-P haha sorry  i guess i lied before) ;-) <333, HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! No comment... :P,Positive
8758,describe... your garden?, Hmmm  my Garden. Well it has 2 sections to it.  It starts off with a pond and a patio area  then the first section is long and narrow (ish) and goes all the way to a square shapped holey trellace thing. Its all covered in grass  but then around the edges are flower beds and trees. If you go to the end of the garden and turn left  there is more kind of around the corner  behind our garage. Then it goes onto a raised patio platform thing with a swing chair thing and it goes a little more along the back (length ways). That doesn't make ANY SENSE! Here :) lol http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11088742&amp;id=750810466 It goes on a bit longer  and goes around the corner a little at the top and bottom. Its an odd shape  so its hard to explain :P,Positive
8759,describe... your house???, My house? Well  my family own 5  but I assume the one that I live in now? Its a detached bungalow with a loft conversion. Its rather cool actually  in the front left and right corners  we have turrets (in my bedroom and the dining room) which make it look slightly like a castle :D My drum kit is in one of the turrets  and I think it fits nicely :)  Then we have a wooden balcony thing overlooking the garden. The Garden is made up of 2 sections really. Its a long stretch of land thing  then at the end  you turn left and it goes back and along slightly  hard to explain really lol.,Positive
8760,describe... your morning routine???, Get up  make a drink. Drink the drink  sort out something to wear  get dressed then wash. Eat some toast  tidy my room and do my make up then hair. Thats about it for the morning :),Positive
8761,describe... your voice???, My voice??? Ummm... I have been told my quite a few people  that I have quite a nice voice. I speak quite clearly  and I don't think I really have a regional accent  obviously an English accent  but I don't sound Bristolian or anything (at least I don't think I do). I suppose Im softly spoken  and its been said that I have a slightly lower pitched voice? I dunno lol...,Positive
8762,did you also know i sneeze when i eat/chew anything minty?, My mum does too. Just cant handle your peppermint...,Positive
8763,did you but my tweety balloon?, What? :/,Positive

8766,did you know car airbags kill 1 person for every 22 lives that they save? :-(, REALLY???!??!?!??!?!!? OMG! Thats...bad :/ Still worth having them though  you think? I think that your seat should have them too  and push you up out of the roof. How cooooool would that look?! Car crash (not cool) and you pop out the top! LOL! *tries to stop oneself from laughing at the image* O_O,Positive
8767,Did you know Ice cream makes me cough?, Probably because you microwave it too long. Make it 10 seconds less  and your throat muscles will be fine :),Positive
8768,did you know that ellie goulding is no longer going to be supporting passion pit in bristol?, What?! No way!! Im glad I didn't get tickets then. How come she pulled out? :(,Positive

Would you like me to come up with more?, Why not? :) Although I can't promise an answer tonight  I think im too tired and can't really be bothered to use my brain at the moment. Im not even thinking of my answers  just letting my hands do the typing  and this is what is coming out.... :D,Positive
8770,did you miss me?!? :-D, I MISSED YOU!!!! *Cries uncontrollably* :(,Positive
8771,Did you watch Gok Fashion Fix this lovely sunday morning ? i did  personally i thought it was shit., This lovely sunday morning I was working :P (or getting ready for work). Shame I missed it  my tiny bit of morning TV was occupied by Wife Swap USA. Im sure I can cope without a bit of Gok for a while :P,Positive
8772,Did you watch the Winter Olympics opening ceremony?, No I didn't  I was driving. It was last night yeah?,Positive
8773,digital clocks or... non-digital clocks? :-P, non-digital :P Analogue yeah? I think clocks can be really pretty and expressive  but digital is so literal  where is the love???? lol,Positive
8774,dirt or sand?, Sand :) although I don't really want either lol,Positive
8775,do 'dirty' minds really think alike? do any minds really think alike?, Yeah  I think they do. It depends on how much you can relate to that person  there is someone out there who I think my mind relates to prettttttttttty well  and they know who they are :P,Positive
8776,do every say/type a word wayyyy too often (like i always say.. haha and '...' too often)?, Did you mean  &quot;do I ever&quot;? In which case  yes I do. I type &quot;lol&quot; FAR too often!

Bad habits  bad habits  bad habits  ermmmmmm...I don't know if its a habit  but when I get into bed at night  I HAVE to clean the bottom of my feet and/or socks  just in case there is any dirt or anything I have picked up off of the floor. LOL  that may be more of an OCD thing  but I can't get into bed thinking that my feet may be dirty lol.,Positive
8779,Do news reporters wear pants behind the news desk?, Of course they don't. What's the point in getting dressed? I think they all have bets on to see who wears the best underwear ;),Positive
8780,Do people tell you that you act older  younger  or your age?, I think I am mature for my age  but sometimes I could be spotted being idiotic  which really isn't my age. It depends on what mood im in. I get hyper pretty easily  but I won't show it unless im comfortable with the people I am around. If im with family and close friends  STUPID KELLY COMES OUT :D,Positive
8781,Do the minutes on the movie boxes include the previews  credits  and special features  or just the movie itself?... you are going into film... after all ;-), I am indeed  and I do actually know :) They include just the film and the ending credits. 90 minutes is considered a feature film  so anything WAYYY less  is a phoney excuse for a film :P,Positive

8790,Do you also ship lousie?, YES I DO!!!! ;),Positive
8791,Do you beleive you can be with someone  say nothing and walk away feeling like you have had the best conversation in your life?, I don't think i have ever had that if im honest. I have had it  where you have had a conversation or moment with someone  and then everytime you meet  speak to or see them again  you expect that same 'connection' thing to happen  and when it doesn't  you are utterly disappointed :(,Positive
8792,do you believe i magic?, I don't really no. I don't think things can be moved or changed due to someones will. If you mean magic in the sense of chemistry between 2 people  then hell yessssss :P,Positive
8793,do you believe in any superstitions?, Umm  well I wouldn't say that I really believe in them  but I don't like to take my chances either lol. As for the stepping on cracks  or walking under a ladder  thats probably bull crap  but still  little things like &quot;swearing on someones life&quot; or smashing a mirror  I get a little creaped at :P How about you?,Positive
8794,Do you believe in God?, Umm  I don't know what I believe really. I think there is more to life than this though. Than living  dying  the end. I just don't know what.,Positive
8795,Do you believe in Karma and Destiny?, I would like to believe in those things  it is a really nice thought. However  there are some people who seem to get the good things happen to them constantly  no matter of how they treat others. So  No :(,Positive
8796,Do you believe in life after death? If so  what kind? i.e. reincarnation  Heaven/Hell  something else?, I suppose this is kind of the same as my last,Positive
8797,Do you believe in the afterlife? Reincarnation?, I do actually. Well I believe that this life cannot be the end. I think there is something after our lives  but I wouldn't know what. How about you? Any beliefs?,Positive
8798,Do you believe that everything happens for a reason?, I wish it did  and I think that things can happen to people that make them a better person  but only because they choose to learn from their mistakes. So  I think it can happen for a reason  its all about making the most of the things that do happen :),Positive
8799,Do you believe that what comes around goes around?, I would like to think that yes  but unfortunately I don't think it works that way :(,Positive
8800,Do you consider yourself a happy person?, I was  but I kind of go back and fourth. It depends on what is happening in my life at that point. I would say yes  but things can affect me really easily. Usually with other people  perhaps doing or saying something rather upsetting :(,Positive
8801,do you crack your knuckles?, Oh God no! That creeps me out! Besides being REALLY bad for your bones  it sounds horrible :S Do you?,Positive
8802,Do you daydream sometimes? What do you often daydream about?, I don't really day dream no  I haven't for yearssss I don't think actually :),Positive
8803,Do you dream often?, I don't think so. But there again  I go through phases. Sometimes it takes me weeks to have another dream  but then other times  its daily. Odd.,Positive
8804,do you enjoy drinking? do you drink often?while out or home alone?, I take it you mean alcohol? Because of course I like to drink liquids  otherwise I wouldn't be alive anymore :P Haha. Im not actually a big drinker  at all really. I mean  when I go out  I do drink quite a bit  but I know when I am at my limit and I stop (apart from once at a work evening  and I was BADDDDD when I got home lol). I don't really drink at home  its only when I go out to a club or something. Usually I just opt for a coke or something  perhaps a cocktail (if im out) but it doesn't contain enough alcohol to make an effect :),Positive
8805,do you eventually want to get married?, Oh god yes! I know lots of people today  are totally skipping marriage  and I don't really think that it changes much in someones relationship. However  marriage is about loyalty to each other  and I love that :) I wouldn't want a marriage to change my life from how it was before though (if that makes sense?)  I don't think a certificate saying that you both are legally now joined should change the way you treat each other. Getting married can also take a spark out of a relationship  and thats sad :(,Positive
8806,do you ever actually read my responses to your questions? just curious..., I do indeed! :D I check for answers of any question that I post  no point in asking them otherwise is there? :P,Positive
8807,Do you ever think 'why bother'?, Frequently :(,Positive
8808,do you ever think that you are annoying?, Yes  all the time! My moods change a lot (not in a bad way)  I just mean that I could be normal one minute (whatever normal is) and the next  really hyper. So when I go all hyper  I can imagine myself annoying the person im chatting to. Do you think im annoying? lol,Positive
8809,Do you fancy Americans? Don't lie ;), Yeah  I do. But then I would also fancy Canadians (;))  English  Scottish  irish  welsh  French  Italian  australians  etc etc etc..you see where im going with this :P NOT THAT I FANCY EVERYONE! lol  I just mean  they dont HAVE to be American :P,Positive
8810,do you feel angry?, No.,Positive
8811,do you feel depressed?, No.,Positive
8812,Do you feel you have a purpose or calling in life?, Not really no lol. My head is a bit muddled with everything at the moment  so try asking me in a couple of years :),Positive
8813,do you get along with you age group well? or are you better with younger or older people?, I think I do get along with most people pretty easily. I think older people  are probably the least I get on with (older as in 10 years ish) because I clash a little with my views  opinions etc. I definitely get along with my own age group  and younger people the same  if not better :) Sorry  that was a boring answer :/,Positive
8814,Do you get drunk quickly?, I actually don't :( I tend to have to drink WAY more than my friends before I feel the affects of alcohol :( I think my tally once was about 15 vodka/cokes and I still wasn't that drunk. Only tipsy :( I eventually gave up lol!,Positive
8815,Do you give out second chances too easily?, FARRRR TOO EASILYYYYY! :( I sometimes feel a bit walked over because of it too. My theory is  if you love someone that much  you would rather forgive than forget them :(,Positive
8816,do you hate it when your bottom/floating rib get in a weird place and hurts?, I hate a lot of things when it hurts  not just a rib digging in :),Positive
8817,Do you have a lucky number? and why?, I never really did the lucky number thing  sorry.,Positive
8818,do you have a nickname  that you don't mind people calling you?, Hmmmm  Kel? lol Im not a nickname kind of person. Unluckily  my name rhymes with a few not so nice things  so I went through all the smelly  welly  telly  belly jokes at school lol. There is one name that my mum calls me  for some random reason  called 'Fred'. I have NO idea why  may name is not Winifred  but still she continues to call me it. Its suck now  but I think its a mum thing and anyone else using it would be weird :/,Positive
8819,Do you have a particular age that you want to be married? Do you have an age limit on marriage/starting a family (like i have to at least be over the age of 'blah  blah  blah') and why?, Well  I don't have a plan as such  because I think it varies with each person. I mean  if the person I was dating was shaky say  then I would be more reluctant to start a family with them  but it could change later in like  and I actually get married to them. I would like to have kids by the time I am 40 though lol! Married by mid 30's? the latest?  Im not big on dates or anything  it just depends on when the right person comes along :),Positive
8820,Do you have a T.V. in your bedroom?, OMG! Imagine if I didn't! Wow! Terrible :( So  yes I do :),Positive
8821,do you have any allergies?, I don't actually :) Im pretty easily going when it comes to allergies :) Im lucky :D,Positive

8823,Do you have any strange phobias?, Only cockroaches  but I don't think thats strange :P Ohhhhh  and dust  but thats more a cleanliness thing.,Positive
8824,do you have glasses?, I don't wear glasses  but I do have a couple of pairs of glasses with just plastic in the lenses :P They look cool  but one  Geek glasses! HELLLO! <<< COOLESS! XD,Positive
8825,do you have your wedding all planned out? what did you want your wedding to be like as a child? do you want it that way? did you ever think about it? do you still think about it?, I never actually did the whole wedding planning thing. I haven't thought much about what I want my wedding to be like either. I want it to be more about the person  rather than all the material things that I don't deem as a priority :),Positive
8826,Do you keep a journal or a blog?, I have a Livejournal  but I don't really update it that regularly :(,Positive
8827,Do you know how bored i get when you're not answering questions?, Shame I dont edit my life to sort out your entertainment issues isnt it? :P,Positive
8828,Do you know how special you are?, Of course. Im me  that makes me special :),Positive
8829,Do you know how to surf?, I have a surf board  but its never been in water. Does that count? :P,Positive

8832,Do you know who Peter Prevc is?, No Idea. Sounds fictional :/,Positive
8833,Do you know?, I do.,Positive
8834,Do you like answering long answered questions or short ones?, Long questions definitely  only because it means I can get all my opinions out onto the page  rather than this or that.  They feel more worth wile :),Positive
8835,Do you like banana's?, Indeed :) But no a scary amount  just a normal amount lol,Positive
8836,Do you like carrots?, I do! But only cooked. Not raw because they are hard to swallow  and also chewy :/ As a result  EWWWW! lol,Positive
8837,Do you like cats?, I have four  but that doesn't necessarily mean I like them all the time. 96% of the time  they are in my good books  quite opposite to the lie detector result of that on Jeremy Kyle right? ;),Positive
8838,Do you like chocolate with caramel?, Umm  not really. DEFINITELY not in chocolate bars :S I like pure chocolate  pure sweetness is enough,Positive
8839,Do you like fish? If so  what kind? I like to butter mine., You butter your fish? lol! Im not really a big fish fan actually. I like some  though  eg  tuna  cod and salmon. But thats about it. I hate strong tasting fish too. Definitely not a fan :(,Positive
8840,do you like granite?, Granite? As in tiles and stuff? Well yeah  I guess :( RANDOM! lol. It makes the kitchen work tops look nice :),Positive
8841,Do you like hospital dramas?, ermmm  nah. How much variation can you really have in a hospital? and do they all really have to be white? A splash of colour here and there (not green or blue << BOY COLOURS) would do nicely :),Positive
8842,do you like it or hate it when people play with your hair?, I really like it actually :) I think its really soothing. But if im just getting ready to go out  and I just styled my hair  and someone is playing with it. Thats kind of annoying :P lol,Positive

8859,Do you like the questions I ask or do you want: More personal ones? More individual ones? More 'this or that' ones? More 'do you like___?' ones? More other (please specify) ones?, I like the individual side of them  only because it makes you think about things you wouldn't normally question.

8870,Do you like your handwriting?, I do  but only when I concentrate on it. If I scribble something quickly  then it ends up looking a mess. When I am doing a piece of writing  I tend to start off neatly  and as I get more into it  I write quicker  and it starts to turn to scribbling :P,Positive
8871,Do you like your independence or do you want to have the big wedding  wife  puppy and kids?, I like a little of both if im honest. More than anything  I want to be happy  and I think love/family makes up a big part of that. So  I definitely want the big family thing  but I would still want a little independance from it? If that makes sense? Only in the case  to spend it away from the kids and with the one that I loved :),Positive
8872,do you like your last name?, I actually do quite like my last name yeah? Do you like it? I have to be honest  and say I have never really thought about it but still  thinking now  yeah I do :) Its short and straight to the point lol! I like your name! Its so cute :),Positive
8873,do you like your laugh?, I think my laugh could be a lot worse :P I don't really have a stand out laugh at all really  I sometimes can giggle pretty funny but I haven't had any comments on it either. So thats probably a good thing :),Positive
8874,Do you love massages?, I do :) Who doesn't love a massage? :D But only from my girlfriend (if I had one)  I would find it awkward going to a salon or whatever lol,Positive
8875,do you love me??? ;-) <3333, I LOVE YOU!!!! <333,Positive
8876,Do you love someone  other than family?, I love a lot of people  but I take it you mean romantically? Then no  unfortunately :(,Positive
8877,do you love someone?, I love lots of people :)  What can I sayyyy  im a very loving person :),Positive
8878,Do you love the Brizzle?, I love the Brizzle. The question is  do you?,Positive
8879,Do you miss someone a lot right now?, I do  but I think its going down  like how much I miss them. Which is a good thing :D,Positive
8880,do you need a wee?, No  thanks. Im cool :),Positive
8881,do you need music to help you sleep?, Actually I prefer not to listen to music when I sleep  only because then I get songs stuck in my head  then I can't sleep :(,Positive
8882,Do you need to know everything about someoneu2019s past?, No  because what is in the past  is the past. The future is what involves you. However  somethings (eg serial murders  or excessive cheating in a partners sense) would be hard to over look. It completely depends on what that person has done and whether I personally can overlook it.,Positive
8883,do you own a vibrating toy ;), It's big and pink and fluffy ;) ;) haha!,Positive
8884,do you paint? or sketch? :-?, Sketching is my life lol. and painting  yes I do :) There are some random sketches on my Twitpic account if you are interested :),Positive
8885,Do you prefer blondes or brunettes and why?, I would say it doesn't make a difference really. I prefer blonde hair  looks wise  but I don't think the colour of someones hair makes who they are. Its their personality that I would look for :),Positive
8886,Do you prefer hugs or kisses?, Hmmm  I think hugs :) I love hugs!!! Especially from the behind when someone wraps their arms aroung you <3333 There is someone in work who ALWAYS does it  and it makes me melt :))))) I obviously like kisses too  hmmm  can I say both? :D Be greedy? :D,Positive
8887,do you prefer younger girls or older?(in terms of a relationship  that is  haha)do you have a preference? just seeing if i stand any sort of chance <3 haha (slightly kidding);-), hahaha! and who is wanting to stand a chance? ;) Ages really doenst actually matter to me. I mean  it does to an extent  I wouldnt date an old person (oh god  that sounds terrible even to say :S) but I dont think of someone and whether their age is suitable.  If I was to choose  I would say older  mainly because I would prefer someone more mature (not in the scary old sense lol). But it completely depends on that person  I wouldnt rule someone out just because of their age :) I would look for personality  above looks. Does that answer the question? :),Positive
8888,Do you read Skins fanfiction?, OF COURSE! Skins isn't long enough  so we need to prolong it somehow :),Positive
8889,Do you read smut fanfic? bahahah, HELL YEAH!!! Nothing like a bit of smut before bedtime ;) HAHA!,Positive
8890,dO YOU REALLY THINK I'D MAKE SUCH AN OBVIOUS TYPO?r r *CAPS, You're special. Anything is possible when someone is special ;),Positive
8891,Do you regret anything?, Too many things. If I could go back and change things in my past  I would  and I would probably be a completely different person for it. But there is no point in dwelling right? I think I turned out reasonably okay :),Positive
8892,Do you ship any random people?, I guess. But none right now :),Positive
8893,Do you ship anyone from Leicester?, Everyone from leicester is 'onit' for everyone. It clouds my judgement  so yes :) I ship you all with all all. How entertaining :P,Positive
8894,do you ship kexy?, It has a certain ring to it ;) lol,Positive
8895,Do you ship real people?, oh hell yeah! Real people just extend our shipping abilities :),Positive
8896,do you smoke?, Oh god no!!! I can't STAND smoking! The smell of it  the taste of it...its a no no. How about you?,Positive
8897,Do you snore or Steal the covers or Roll around in your sleep?, I don't know lol. It's been a while since anyone has been able to let me know. I don't think I snore though  because I have been on holiday with family  and no one complained about any snoring  only from my father  but I think thats just dads in general :P,Positive
8898,do you sometimes feel like an attention seeker?, Sometimes I guess  but isn't everyone? If I do  I always have a valid reason :),Positive
8899,Do you still have tonsils?, HAHA! It's funny you asked that actually! I do yes  and when I Was at the Lady Gaga gig  there was a curtain that came down in front of the stage  and video was projected onto the curtain. Because I was RIGHT at the front  I was looking directly up to it  and when I started screaming  I could feel my tonsils vibrating in the back of my throat lol!! I thought I was swallowing them! HAHAHA! Not a nice feeling :S,Positive
8900,Do you stroke your pussyr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r CAT?, I think there needs to be some age ratings on these questions. Who's with me?,Positive
8901,do you take long or short showers?, LONG SHOWERS!!! I don't know how its possible to take a short shower lol. The hot water and steam? Mmmmm :),Positive
8902,Do you take showers in the morning or at night more?, I prefer showers at night  okay because it gets me all cosy for bed and stuffffff. Besides  showers in the morning are usually COLDDDDD :(,Positive
8903,Do you think fairy tales influence our choice of a partner?, Oh yes definitely. Well  I know that they make every girl want to have their own price charming. The princes in fairytales  don't exist in real life  or at least not very often  so to think 'the girl always gets the perfect prince' isn't a very good representation of real life :(,Positive
8904,do you think i look cool in this hat?, Do you ever not look cool? Is it possible?,Positive
8905,do you think i look rather sexy pink?, No Louise. Change it back :(,Positive
8906,do you think i look sexy purple?, I like yours purple  only because you still look like you. Louse looked like some random devil being thing :/,Positive
8907,do you think ill ever get a girlfriend? the chances are lessening more and more :'-(, No they aren't. You perhaps aren't looking in the right places :) You will find her  she is out there somewhere :),Positive
8908,do you think it is possible to ever run out of questions to ask someone? :-p, No :P It gets harder  but there are always things to find out. Perhaps a limit to things you want to know  but hey ho....its a challenge :P,Positive
8909,Do you think the family of a murder victim should have any say in what punishment is given to the murderer?, Well  its hard to say isn't it? I mean  heaven forbid I was in that situation  I would want everything shitty to come down on that person  but it still doesn't bring them back does it? Personally  I would prefer someone to undergo a lifetime of suffering  than any death penalty. You know? I think that the family shouldn't get a say  but its hard to comment  because I know I would.,Positive
8910,do you think you are sexy? or that you can be sexy at certain times?, I don't think im sexy at all! lol I don't have very much confidence  and I think the biggest part of being sexy  is exerting a body confidence.  I suppose that can change in time  but for the moment. No lol.,Positive
8911,do you think you're immature?, I don't think so. I think Im too immature at times.,Positive
8912,Do you trust easily?, I think I trust FAR too easily! It means I tend to get hurt more than people who don't let people in. What does it gain you in the end though? Nothing :(,Positive
8913,do you use a purse? often?, Well I assume you mean bag? Because a purse over here  is like a wallet lol. In which case  I do yes :) Sometimes if Im just popping out for 10 minutes or something  then no  but it depends on where I am going and what I need to take :),Positive
8914,DO YOU WANT BEEF BLUD!?!, Louise Louise Louise...at least make yourself invisible or whatever. Fail...,Positive
8915,Do you want children? Boys? Girls?, Yeah I definitely want kids. I don't know when or how  (obviously it cant be the traditional way) but I would only want them when Im settled in a steady relationship  with a heathy income  and im able to look after them. I have no preference over a girl or a boy  but whenever the time is right  either would be fantastic :),Positive
8916,do you wear dresses?, I LOVE to wear dresses  indeed I do! Im more a casual dress person  as in I go out in the day in a dress  rather than dressing up in a really special dress in the evening. If that makes sense? I Still wear dresses in the evening  obviously  but im not one of those people who says 'Im wearing a dress for special occasions only'. I think I actually wear dresses more than any other item of clothing. Besides leggings that is  but they usually come together :),Positive
8917,Do you wear pajamas to places other than at your house?, I think I have worn them when I have driven somewhere to pick someone up. But I never got out of the car  and I think it was only once. Thats not too bad right? :),Positive
8918,Do you work or go to school/college?, I work at the moment  but I do independent projects on the side. I have a place at Brighton Film School for september  so I will return to education then :),Positive
8919,do your scars remind you that the past is real?, Yes. But in an odd sense  they also remind you that you are so fragile and anything can be a turning point in your life  and I don't just mean physically :),Positive
8920,does height matter?, No  of course not :) Do you mean with myself or in a partner or friend? If im talking partners  then I actually prefer someone who is a shorter than me. Only because I like to be protective and look after my loved one  so if they're shorter than me  I can envelope them :D lol,Positive
8921,Does it bother you that a lot of your followers more than likely found your twitter through some Skins related tweet you had done at a party or premiere?, Bother me? Its how you become a celebrity today ;) Don't do things by yourself  its who you date or marry that make you famous :P lol,Positive
8922,Does love = sex?, No. The act of sex  in a relationship is a big part of showing your love for someone  its about sharing a connection  you know? Sex however  isn't love  and anyone who think so  should be shot :P,Positive
8923,Does size matter? ;), Haha  it depends on what you are talking about ;) lol For some people I suppose it does  but with me  it really doesnt. With everything I mean  any certain...parts  doesn't matter  height of a partner or friend  doesn't matter  So no. Size  in anything  I don't give a shit :),Positive
8924,dolphin :L its all about having a Wolf or a lion!!, DOLPHINS DON'T KILL OR EAT YOU :),Positive
8925,don't lie. you love it., I love the entertainment. Perhaps not the content.,Positive
8926,Don't you just hate people?, Only ones that come into my restaurant and end up in the section that Im serving  yes.,Positive
8927,dont you just hate the go compare advert?, OMG! You know when he is looking and singing through the letterbox? I think someone should have been the other side of it with a twig. That would have gone down nicely with a twig in the eye ;),Positive
8928,door or window?, Window :) For example  your lover coming in through the window <33333 lol,Positive
8929,dream car/bike/van?, HAHA! Your answer to this question made me laugh! The car that I really wanted  (before I settled with mine) was a 5 dr Toyota Rav 4 :P In light metallic blue with grey bumpers! Made me laugh that we wanted the same one lol!  So anyway  my dream car  do you mean affordable or in a dream world? I will say both :) If money wasn't an option  I would probably choose something like a porshe Carrera GT Cabriolet  only because <333333333 But in the real world  I am happy to say I own my dream car :D A New Beetle Cabriolet. I have it in light metallic blue and have blue and white flowers/birds down the side. If I could change the colour  I would. I LOVEEEEEEE the dark metallic navy one  with the cream leather. I would actually jizz if I ever bought one like that! LOL! It costed me just over u00a37 000 and that was a lot of money for me having just turned 19  but I saved up and managed to get it :) The insurance is a bitch though  but luckily its fairly economical to run :) I also really wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler Golden Eagle in Black  but they came out last year I think  and its far too much money for me to spend on a car. Besides  they devalue really easily  and rust quite badly :(,Positive
8930,Drugs; good  bad  ugly? Opinions generally please., Well if you mean the legal kind  then gooood! Because they are there to help you  if you mean the illegal kind  not good  although I can see why people give into them unfortunately :(,Positive
8931,embrace the naughtyness right?r, right...,Positive
8932,Emo??? It's Say Anything  I'd say it was closer to Indie my love., Same thing :P lol!,Positive

8937,ever been hit with a golf club?, I just Loled! Im worried about you. I really am.,Positive
8938,Ever been in a physical fight? If yes how many and who were they with?, Yes  far too many :S All with my sister though LOL! Its been UGLYYYYYY! Although  I Was at school  and I got into a fight with my best friend over something. I can't even remember what is was about. No one was hurt  but it involved bottles of fruit juice being trown at each other. Pretty funny looking back  not at the time seeing as I was a walking insect trap...,Positive
8939,Ever been skinny dipping?, Not yet no lol,Positive

8947,ever fallen asleep on the floor? not while drunk..., No lol. All the floors in my house (apart from the upstairs  but I never really go up there anyway) are wooden or tiled  so its not the nicest and most comfortable place to fall asleep :S I don't think I have done it while drunk either. If im drunk  and I eventually go to bed  I actually have real problems getting to sleep (not that I don't anyway lol). But I can't switch off :( and not because the room is spinning or anything  just can't get to sleep :( Then I wake up extra early  all in all  pretty sucky :P,Positive
8948,Ever felt that no one relates to you?, Yes  many times. But I think everyone has those feelings. The ones where you're like. &quot;Is that normal?&quot;  but by saying that  makes you normal  because everyone has their insecurities  its just about opening up about them :),Positive
8949,ever golf?, No lol. Crazy golf  hell yeah! but not the standard &quot;lets stand and decide on which direction to hit our ball in before deciding which bag of clubs to use&quot; type :P,Positive

8954,ever have a dirty dream(s)????, Perhaps occasionally :P Involving a certain Loveless actress ;) HAHA!,Positive
8955,ever just doubt everything?, Yes. Its times when one thing happens  and it causes you to question everything else  kind of like a Domino effect. Thats why its important to trust the right people  and to close up with certain things (even though I can never seem to do that) :(,Positive
8956,ever kiss a frog?, No  and I can't say I have ever intended to..,Positive
8957,Ever randomly start crying  and you just couldnt control it? :'-(, Yes  the same with laughter too. You don't know why you are laughing  but the more you think about it  the more you laugh. Its rather funny  to watch and to experience :P Ever had it?,Positive
8958,ever run out of things to ask?, Yes lol  thats normally the point where I stop asking until more things pop back in... Kind of like eating if you think about it? &quot;I'm hungry  give me food...I don't want anymore food  stop feeding me. I'm hungry again  feed me...&quot; Okay  you get my gist... lol,Positive
8959,Ever seen a therapist?, No  but I sometimes think I perhaps should...,Positive

8962,Ever wanted to become a tattooist?, I would like to be a tattoo designer  thats cool  but never the tattooist. I couldn't handle peoples blood on me (even if its through gloves) lol.,Positive
8963,ever wonder how the hell did i end up here??, Yeah  I have done on occasion. Usually while drunk or out of it of sorts lol... Joking  but yeah  I have.,Positive
8964,evr get a lap dance?, haha  I have never had a lap dance no lol. I don't actually see the obsession with them if im honest. Like  if its from a girlfriend  then yeah  obviously  but a randomer in a strip club...er...no thanks lol.,Positive
8965,Excluding romantic love  when was the last time you told someone you loved them?... what about including?, Ummm  I don't know  I really don't keep track lol. Im always telling my family that I love them  because I think its VERY important for someone to be reminded of how they feel  especially seeing as you don't know what can happen from one day to the next.  Including romantic love  a little while lol.,Positive
8966,expand of the 'would you?' question...? :-), Hmmm  its more difficult when answering it isn't it? haha Would I... Of course :) If you wanted to  indeed :D I live to please (not like that HAHA) people  so its nice to make others happy :D,Positive

8976,favorite holiday?, I have been on  or want to take? The favourite holiday I have taken  would have to be the first time when I went to Orlando with my family. I was pretty young  about 10 or something  and well  a kid let loose in Orlando? CAUSES A RIOT ;) lol,Positive
8977,favorite kind of flower?, Lilies :D The Tiger Lily is just <3 :D,Positive
8978,favorite month?, Hmmm  I don't know if I have one  but I have a least favourite month? I HATE January  only because the hype of Christmas is over  and everyone makes so many things about the new year  which usually gets broken within the first week lol. Besides  this year  January really wasn't a good month :( So  best would be  June? BECAUSE ITS WHEN WE GET HEAT! Hopefully...lol,Positive

8981,favourite accent?, Australian  I just love it XD,Positive
8982,favourite book?? do you enjoy reading?, I don't actually read all that often  I get distracted easily so my attention span can be short on things unless im really into it :) I tend to read informational books though (that makes me sound like a geek  but buggar it! GEEKS ARE IN! :D),Positive
8983,favourite colour  in general  (or top 2)? favourite colour  to wear? 2 colours (in the same piece of jewelry) that you think look really good together (like green and blue  red and brown  green and brown  etc etc).. like in the same pendant or something??, I didn't really understand most of this question  but I will salvage what I can from it lol. Favourite colour  I would say blue :) Favourite colour to wear is probably dark grey. Only because it goes with my hair AMAZINGLY :D In jewellery  I would say perhaps dark blue and gold? I know blue and yellow technically contrast  but what can I say? I love them together :D,Positive

8989,favourite song?, At the moment  Ellie Goulding- 'Starry Eyed' (Jackwob remix),Positive
8990,Favourite type of ice cream?, Mint Chocolate chip  UNLESS its Ben &amp; Jerry's :) ANY flavour of Ben and Jerry's would suit me amazingly :D And Im not even an ice-cream person :D,Positive
8991,fight for the one or settle for someone amazing?, Hmmm  well 'the one' may not actually be the one. You know? I think everyone should fight for the right person  but it depends on how that effects that other person too. For example  say 'the one' was someone that perhaps didn't feel the same OR didn't treat you how you deserved to be treated  then I would settle for someone amazing  because in turn  that could be the one. It's all about giving them a chance :),Positive
8992,Finish this sentence in at least another sentence:  Once upon a time there was a boy named Joel and a girl named Jane..., Joel was the local milkman  and Jane was his friendly cactus...,Positive
8993,Fire or electric heater?... im curious... so im recycling your questions.. reduce-reuse-recycle  right? haha :-), Hmm  well considering electric heaters are portable  I would say electric heaters. They go right to the source of non-heat :P lol Fires are cosier though  and they do look a lot nicer. So it depends on how cold I actually am  and where abouts I am sat :),Positive
8994,First thing you will save in a fire?, Probably photos or things with sentimental value. Apart from animals and people lol!,Positive
8995,First word to come to mind when I say the following word:  Banana, Yellow.,Positive

8997,fluff or smut?.. and yes  you have to pick one ;-) haha, HAHA! In real life or in fanfiction? lol Well in fanfiction  fluff :) Especially when its all romantic and cute to read  because like you said  that can lead to smut too haha! As for real life  I would probably say fluff again :) Im more a fan of cute moments than...other moments ;) haha,Positive
8998,focus more  on your own stuff (like be busy by yourself.. or more focused on whats going on with other people...?, Oh other people definitely! I like to help people out (partially because it distracts me from my own shit) :P,Positive

9003,fruits or vegetables?, Fruits :) Especially Pineapple! YUMMMMMMY! :D,Positive
9004,FUCK OFF!! TAYLOR SWIFT ALL THE WAAAY!, Nahhhhh. To be fair  she cant sing that well. She has a nice voice for the songs she sings  but there again  she is written them based on her voiced. I dont think Louise would agree with you there ;),Positive
9005,Generally  in life  what makes you happy?, When I see that others are happy. Orrrrrr  if I do something for someone  and I see it is really appreciated  that is one of the best feelings you can have :D I like to do things for other people  and its not generally returned  but still  I do love the feeling of giving :),Positive
9006,GET TO KNOW  BRUP BRUP  LE7!!, I thought it was &quot;Brap Brap&quot;?,Positive
9007,Give me drum lessons ?, Sure thannnnng :),Positive
9008,give or receive? ;), A nice balance of both :) But I must admit  I am a very generous and giving person...work it out ;),Positive
9009,going a bit crazy... probly b/c i haven't spoken to you since last night... ;-), Awwwww  now you know how I feel when you are at school :P Soooo  I think  how about I quit my job  and you quit school? They we wouldn't be crazy and everyone stays sane. Poor and dumb  but at least we are sane and have each other ;) ha!,Positive
9010,gold or blue?, Well  in a jewellery sense  Gold? lol,Positive
9011,gold or silver?, Hmmm  how about both? Together :D,Positive
9012,good night  you sexy beast you!!! ;-) rawrrrr, HAHAHAHAHA! Thanks! (O) _ (O) Good niiiiiiight!!! *growls back in a sexy tone* LOL!,Positive
9013,good old JC., Old is definitely accurate :P,Positive
9014,goodnight<333 dream sweet dreams ;-), YOU TOOOOOO! When you go to bed that is! Im actually going now  so I will speak to you tomorrow night :( I will miss you until then :'( Sleep well gorgeous! <3,Positive
9015,grey's anatomy is amazingggggg :-D almost as amazing as skins... ;-), Hmmmmmm  now I know this is from one of two people. Is that you Tori? I think Im correct :D HOWDY! I have never properly watched it  but I probs will one day :) Any episodes I should skip to?,Positive
9016,ground or chair (to sit on)?, Hmmm  is the ground dirty? then chair :) Unless there is something I can sit on  then that. OR if im wearing a skirt or dress  nahhh  still chair :) Im classy like that ;),Positive
9017,haha  yea. i think its more that have a fairly dirty mind in general.. but i 'express' it more online.. if people knew what i was thinking half the time... oh god. lets not go there.. i feel like quite the perv tonight  sorry ;-) haha, Oh nooooooo! I think you should develop that a bit more :P Carry on....what you were thinking half the time....? ;),Positive
9018,Haha  yes  no idea how that happened. But yes  it's not impossible that u may hav come across some of my stuff. I'm a major-angst writer. I wrote Emily on top of a roof before Skins even thought of it. :-P  Ooh Film  interesting?! Excited?!!!, haha! Im more of a fluff lover :P But angst can be a massive importance in all that fluff creation! LOL! Actually nahhh  angst is good too. I like Fics where (Naomily wise) They get together in the story rather than being in a relationship. I think most relationships are best in the discovery period  if that makes sense? :) Film? Ohhh yeah Im excited! ITs gonna be scary  but im sure I will get used to it :D,Positive
9019,haha aloha!well im starting from the beginning so ill let you know when i get farther.umm the first season was really good tho and quite funny but the second season is a bit more dramatic.think i liked the first season more..how was your day? :-D, Im guessing thats &quot;aloha&quot; hello  and not the goodbye. In which case I will continue... So its a bit like Skins then? Getting to know the characters  then into the second season  create a whole load of angst :) My day  well started off nicely lol. Did some odd random creative things today  but had an argument with my dad which put me in a really bad mood lol. Im okay now :) You guys have sparked me out of it  sooooo  THANK YOU :D How have you been? :),Positive
9020,haha callie: You can't pray away the gay! <<<<<best quote ever or what!?!? hahaha <3333 i love her :-D, Oh  I have heard that line before. Can't remember where  probably the show itself :),Positive
9021,haha do you live near a park? we could walk to the park... im at my dad's house.. so we could walk to the beach? which do you prefer  park or beach? in general?, Ummmmm  I can't even think where I do live at the moment :S Ummmmmmmmmm  oh I remember! I do live sort of near a park  but its REALLY scary at night. Best avoid. I have an idea  I have a giant trampoline outside in my garden. How about I pull out the heat lamp thing from the garage  but it over the trampoline  and we can sit on there and chat looking up at the sky? Orrrrr beach works nicely too :D I think I prefer the beach  but I don't love them in the day. I like nice walks along the beach during sunset <33333 thats lush! But Im not a big fan of sunbathing  its just boring :S lol!,Positive
9022,haha how could i possibly make you have a really good laugh  when i cant remember that last really good laugh i had either? :-P this is just sad :-(, :( Well we shall both keep an eye out  if anything makes either of us laugh  post it on here  cool? :D Hug? :),Positive
9023,haha i had several imaginary friends..they were just more extensions of my weirdness... i loved them  but im pretty sure you didn't miss too much  after a while we all went our separate ways..haha ;-P, Awwwwwwwww..never to be seen again. The End. Sad times. I hope they are doing well in life ;),Positive
9024,haha i like comfortable clothes... i love/need high-heels.but i dont own many... :-( i need the height  haha   and the heels dont seem to bother me..i like earthy tones  but i dont own many..or any..i like jeans.. anything  so what are your ideas for me?, Hmmmm  well lets think... For day wear  how about something like this: http://www.polyvore.com/now_feel_overwhelmed_you/set?id=17126145 It has earthy tones  but its well balanced plus its very casual quite comfortable. It you still wanted to stay very girly  and for a warm summer evening BBQ lets say something like this: http://www.polyvore.com/running_away_from_you/set?id=16955552 OR this: http://www.polyvore.com/sweet_memories/set?id=16463192 For an evening look  perhaps dinner out or an evening at the pub maybe a punked up and spicier look: http://www.polyvore.com/baby_you_rock/set?id=16444872 Perhaps going out to a club scene or something a bit more dressed up  a black ensemble? http://www.polyvore.com/bez_naslova/set?id=15743111 and because I know you like Jeans  how about a comfortable warmer option? :) http://www.polyvore.com/love_this_jeans/set?id=15496984 What do you think of the sorts of things so far? Quiet varied  but it can express personality or mooooood :) <3333,Positive
9025,haha i love being hugged from behind!!! i melt too.. :-p nobody does it tho.. so.. i must live without it :-(, :( I would :) Its odd how such small things like that can feel so warming isn't it :D,Positive
9026,haha i think you might be right  too damn special indeed ;-) ill keep you posted., Okay  lets clear up  special males me seem  'special'  im not. Just so as we are sure :P,Positive
9027,haha i think you should tell me.. exactly... where your imagination is going with this?... just curious ;-) i have a feeling it might be better than some fanfics i've read ;-) haha if its anything like my dream is would be..just saying.., Well  personally I think you should tell me where YOU think my imagination SHOULD be going ;);) I don't have much to go by  so you say better than some fanfics you have read? and you are a smut liker yessssss? Hmmmmm *explodes imagination* ;);) lol!,Positive
9028,haha i would love to be YOURSSSS. i'll be your own doll :-P haha i got a t-shirt today that says'<3 I LOVE European accents <3' just thought you should know.haha so  i'll come to visit you..and you can hold me hostage so i dont have to go back sound good?, Well  that may sound a tad good ;) lol! European accents huh? Wellllll  any in particular? :P lol. You can be my manequin then! What kind of things do you like? Or inspire to like? Colours? Styles? fits? Dressers? skirts? Jeans? Leggings? Just so I can start planning ;) <3333,Positive
9029,haha im not as funny as i think i am.. :-P, I think you're funny :) No one elses opinions matter  only yoursssss :D,Positive
9030,haha im sorry about your formspring/twitter addiction... totally my fault :-P mwahaha im diabolical that way ;-) haha p.d.>i dont like clowns either.. i like acrobats and elephants.. :-D, HAHA! Nahh  its a good addiction :) You keep my mind off of other things  and thats a gooooood thing :D So  please continue raping my formspring and twitter wall :P lol I think they have gotten rid of elephants in Circus' haven't they? Im glad  they deserve to be freeeeeeeee...,Positive
9031,haha im such a klutz... ;-), Are you actually accident prone? Or just in the dream? :P,Positive
9032,haha maybe i should try to contain my dirtier side...? what do you think? do i have 'problems'? its a turn off isnt it? sorry, No  You shouldn't  no and no. Enough said :),Positive
9033,haha spoonerism (or marrowsky) is the reversal of letters in words... its a speech impediment.. like saying 'a blushing crow' instead of a 'crushing blow'... its rather annoying. i have it..like barely but it still happens.. its kind of funny sometime :-P, Ohhhhhh! Got it! I do that at times  only when I don't concentrate or something. I think its actually funny! I wouldn't call it an inpediment but thats just me (probably because I do it) anywayyyy....I think its funny. Its cute you do it and can at least laugh at yourself :),Positive
9034,haha sure you can... just let me think of some new questions...hmmm, You disappeared last night missy!!! :P I was DMing you  tweeting you and formspringing you  and you disappeared :( Anywayyyyy  You're in your SAT's right now  hopefully writing away :D,Positive
9035,haha thanks and i LOVEDDDDDDDDDD reading your life story. it was truly fascinating.. and you sound like quite the student :-) and im happy to be considered a friend  gotta love making friends right?haha any plans for the future? something u rly wnt to do?, You loved reading it? Pshhh  was boring :P lol I think both of ours were a bit depressing  but thats the things that stick out most in life  so automatically we remember the sad things over the happier things. Its how our minds work :) Hmmm  future plans. Well apart from wanting a family  and to be happily in love with a successful home and car etc etc As for career plans  my ultimate goal would be to direct independent horror films :) I love how some of them can contain so much art (visually) as they can video. When I say independent  I mean things like &quot;The Descent&quot;  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;  &quot;28 Days Later&quot; etc etc. Im not so much into big budget epic Hollywood movies  because it takes the essence out of capturing a moving image on film. They rely too much on special effects nowadays  and I prefer the retro approach to film making :),Positive
9036,haha well in MOST fanfics Emily turns out to have quite the 'dirty' mind.. ;-) haha... then again idk how much fanfic you read?.. and if its smutty fanfic...? and yea.. i feel like i act way more 'dirty minded' online than i am in real life--WAY MORE ;-), Oh I can relate to that! In person  I think you need more confidence lol. I used to read LOADS of fanfic  and I will admit  I do like to read a nice balance of fluff and smut :P God! Who came up with these words?! haha  epic :) Im sure we could work out a balance in real life ;),Positive
9037,haha yea... we just finished learning about Edgar Allan Poe a week or 2 ago... now that is some twisted shit  he wrote a story on how a man tortued this cat.. in great detail.. and how a guy killed this guy b/c of his eye.. disturbing :-(, WTF? Really? That is some disturbing stufffffff! What do they teach you! I think you should come here and study at an English college. Just saying ;),Positive
9038,haha yes  sorry. i wish i was familiar with the place. and is it so good that you want to stay there? didnt mean to sound creepy there!, haha  no it wasn't creepy  I just didn't understand the question. Well  I do like Bristol  and it is DEFINITELY a good place to go out in  but I will be leaving in about 7 months to go to film school in Brighton (about 4 hours dive away each way).  Its only a year  but when I come back  depending on how film school goes  I may move  completely depending on how my career goes and what opportunities open up for me :) Thanks for asking :),Positive
9039,haha yes  yes you should be holding me to that ;-) haha.. do you think you have a 'dirty' mind? (this was actually a question i wrote down  this morning  to ask you.. this just seems like the perfect time to ask) ;-) haha, HA! Oh dear God...Well...I think  if someone doesn't know me very well  then I can come across as very innocent  but once you know me  perhaps not ;) Well  lets just say  I am very similar to Emily when it comes to being 'innocent' and if I said  that Emily isn't really innocent at all  does that answer your question ;) lol How about you then? (perfect time to return the question) :P,Positive
9040,haha you're keeping me from going insane.. so i think its healthy..... so.. you wanted to kiss me? *blushing* why didnt you..? ;-) haha, Hahahaha! Because I wasn't sure how you would react????????? How would you have reacted? :P,Positive
9041,haha you're pretty awesome, THANKS :D But for some reason  it won't let me ask any more? :( Probably not so awesome now :'( I will keep trying :),Positive
9042,haha you're pretty funny do people tell you that often?, I am? Well thanks :) I don't get told that often  but my humour  its usually stupid humour  so if you find that funny  then cool :),Positive
9043,haha! now THAT was a SPECTACULAR answer.. :-D (about me making you feel all warm and fuzzy by being so sweet) and i have heard 'the writer' and i LOVE it.. actually the first time i heard it was like last night.. haha my friend sent me a vid on youtube:-), Thanks <33333 It makes me cry :'(  Also 'Speechless' by Lady Gaga! LOVE THEM! <3,Positive
9044,hahaha <333 i think i should ship you to my house... or i could just stay over there with you? ;-), Haha  one or the other works :P Although  I have film school in september  plus my own place. So you can be freeeeeee  I vote you come here instead ;) lol. Plus! Brighton is great for young people  so lots of younger cool vintage shops to find things in :) I WANT TO STYLE YOU NOW!!! lol,Positive
9045,hahaha i barely escaped the shops with my life... i just don't like to shop... :-P but you do... maybe you can be my personal shopper person? ;-), I WOULD LOVE TO!!!! I love dressing people up and putting outfits together!!! Totally! Come to England and YOU'RE MINEEEEEEEEE!!!! &quot;mwah ha ha ha ha&quot; ;),Positive
9046,hahaha i love the way you think ;-) and staying in america is fine with me  i havent been there..plus walks on the beach at sunset... and staying in.. and the beach.. sounds perfect to me.. how long shall we stay on this lovely vaction? ;-), Hmmm  how about 2 weeks? 2 weeks in hot  and 2 weeks in cold and the rest of the 4 weeks in bed? ;);) hahahaha! :P,Positive
9047,hahaha LOL will have it in mind. Is it true you british youth drink it straight from the bottle? On this side of the pond we mix it with some juice (sometimes), Well  it depends on where Im going.  If Im going out  then I tend to drink (probably a little too much) straight  to get me &quot;in the mood&quot; then I dont need to drink so much when Im out. Otherwise  if im at home or something  I usually mix i with something and make a cocktail :) Basically  depends on how drunk you want to get lol! Normally yes (to answer your question in a short sentence) but it may just be personally :),Positive
9048,hahaha well neither have i... hmm idk i might bite my bottom lip... supposedly thats sexy  idk.. im not sure..well you'll just have to wait and see... haha ;-) :-p, I should be holding you to that then :P,Positive
9049,hahaha... i want (currently) the blue RAV4!!!!!! haha well originally i wanted it in red  but my dad said that if he is getting me a car..he wont get me a red car..so metallic blue came second! :-P freaky, Haha! The light blue one? Yeahhhhh  thats the cooooool one :P  Good girl ;) lol,Positive
9050,hahahaha awwwwww i miss you too!!! wishing you were here  we would be having such a good time <3 anyway we won't get to chat tonight:-(so check out my pictures on facebook<3love you, I wish I was there too! Wish me over? PLEASEEEEE :) I shall bring....ummm....all the snails you can eat? Nice and fresh ;) haha! LOVE YOU TOOOOOO! <333 Oh  and link me up with the photos  I can't find them :'(,Positive
9051,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA WOULD YOU PICK ME UP FROM THE TRAIN STATION?! u2665u2665u2665, I wont have a car :(,Positive
9052,HAIIIIII!!!!!, TI.,Positive
9053,hand cuffs or ropes?.., Hand cuffs  as long as they aren't too tight :( Ropes burn :S,Positive
9054,happiness  right now  on a scale of 0 (being the least) to 10 (being the highest)?, Hmmmm  well if you mean literally now. I'm not thinking about much  which means im quite content :) Now that im talking to you  8? How about yourself? :D,Positive
9055,have a nice sleep last night? and are you having a good day?, I am if im honest :) I have decided to be really productive and im making another 'Warning Contains Ideas' bag (aka Naomi's bag from Season 3) and Im in a good mood generally :) I didn't sleep well though :( I got woken up 3 times  due to stupid door bells at horrible times in the morning. Butttttt  im good anyway :) How are you doing?,Positive
9056,have any collections?, Collections? Do you mean  do I collect stuff? Well  its funny you ask that  because I used to be a collect-a-holic! Literally anything and everything! I was a hoarder! lol I have grown out of it a bit now  but I still have a lot of the stuff upstairs. You remember the TVs show Buffy and Angel? Well I LOVED them  and I spent about u00a36 000 or something ridiculous collecting all the merchandise they made. Literally EVERYTHING they would release  I would buy with any pocket money or birthday money I would get. I loved collecting all that  but it took up so much space that it went into the loft :( As for other things  Art Sticks (otherwise known as decorated drum sticks)  guitars  shoes (to an extent)  oh everything! lol! Anything someone could collect  I collected it. :/,Positive
9057,Have any nick names? If so  what?, During School  yes :/ Smelly Kelly  Kelly Welly  kell bell  kelly telly  fred... All from my friends too! Keepers huh? :P lol,Positive
9058,have fun...? at SAT prep? ha.ha.. :-P ok well im back  so i feel like i need a nickname for you... idk why  i jsut feel as though i do.. any ideas? this is the first time i'v ever had trouble coming up with a nickname for someone? weird.. :-P, HaHa! Okayyy  lets think... Nothing that is insulting please (and yes I have had insulting things as a name  only because they rhyme  I promise  im not actually 'smelly' lol) So Smelly Kelly  Jelly Kelly  Kelly Belly  Kelly Telly (which is just odd) and no Kell Bell. So other than that  you have free reign :D I get called 'fred' by my mum all the time  I have no idea why  its just been my name for AGESSSSSS. So  up to you :D ANYTHING YOU LIKE!!!! Bar the above ;) I know why you can't think of anything  its because im too damn special to describe in one word ;) haha! joke ;P,Positive
9059,have you always had trouble sleeping?, Pretty much  but it has got worse in the past year or so. I think  I do too much at night lol. I used to try and do all my college work at night which meant I ended up staying up really late  concentrating and went to bed with an energetic mind. Also  my job  because I get home VERY late in comparison to normal jobs   and the work that I do  involves your mind to be VERY active and stuff (ie remembering loads of things to do in your head) I come home  and Im still not able to go to bed until my head has calmed down a bit. So yeah  now its just got worse and worse and worse  but Im dealing :) I think I should just move into your time zone. Just saying :P,Positive
9060,Have you ever been arrested?, Well no  but I had an incident at an Airport where I was taken into a security office and questioned for taking photographs of the outside. They thought I could have been a teenage  white  beret wearing terrorist :P lol,Positive
9061,Have you ever been in a canoe?, I have yeah! Some action outing day thing during school. Wasn't fun  especially getting stuck in the potholes underground :/,Positive
9062,Have you ever been skiing or snowboarding? In real snow or an indoor ski slope?, no  but I really really want to snow board. Just because its so different and there is nothing else like it out there. I want to learn so badly  but in proper snow  not ski slopes  has to be the proper stuff :),Positive
9063,Have you ever been to a martial arts lesson? E.g. Karate  Tae-kwondo  etc?, No  but I went through a phase of ALWAYS wanting to do it (probably stemmed from watching too much Buffy :P),Positive
9064,Have you ever been to a stripclub? If you did  what was it like? ;-), I actually have lol! I was on a college trip to prague  and one night when we went out  the guys wanted to go to this strip club thing. It was pretty funny  because if you were female  it was free to get in  but the boys had to pay.  The night was rather lame  because it was about our 3rd night out in a row  and 4 days without sleep  I was sat on a couch just watching people  not knowing where to look lol! I was only 16  so it was damn illegal to be there  but thats prague for you :P Then I was looking for someone  and I ended up falling down the stairs LOL! Good times...,Positive
9065,have you ever done drugs?, I think everyone at some point has taken some form of drug  but you mean the illegal kind yeah? Well  yes. Some good  some...not so good :(,Positive
9066,have you ever fallen in love? do you believe in love? if so do you believe in love at first sight? <3 oh and happy valentines day btw!!, HAPPY VALENTINES DAY TOO! (Even though I dont really agree with it :P) Personally  I dont think that there can be love at first sight. I think there can be what is described as a very strong connection  but I dont think it is instantly love. I could never love someone without knowing their personality first  so  for me. I have no belief  but I think you can determine whether you could love them from a first meeting :),Positive
9067,have you ever fancied a friend?, Yes unfortunately :( Ever read my fanfic 'Time for Coffee?' That was a BAD 'fall for' :(,Positive
9068,have you ever farted on a bus? and blamed somebody else?, HAHAHA! No I haven't. I don't take busses very often  besides I have a car now  which I don't fart in either lol.,Positive
9069,Have you ever fell in love with a straight girl? Cause I have and is such a sodding torture LoL, ITS MORE THAN TORTURE!!!! Its bloody painful and mind-messing!!! :S Yes is the answer to that :P  I always seem to fall for the straight girl  I need to sort out my Gaydar O_O! lol,Positive
9070,have you ever had a girlfriend, Yes  but its never been anything serious :(,Positive
9071,Have you ever had an ASS talk?  Alcohol Sex Sleep  :-P, I dont think so  at least  I cant remember one while sober O_O,Positive
9072,Have you ever had an imaginary friend?, haha! I don't think I ever did the imaginary friend thing. Did you? Was it good? Did I miss much?,Positive
9073,Have you ever had hetero sex?, Just to piss of Miss Da Silva of Canada  next question...,Positive
9074,Have you ever heard of a film called The Stupids? Have you ever seen it?, No  never even heard of it. What's it about?,Positive
9075,Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?, You would be rather stuck for questions wouldn't you? Awww  poor Tee-tee :P,Positive
9076,Have you ever read MY fanfiction? Just curious who has and hasn't...lol., Ermmmm  I may have. What one is it? What's it about?,Positive

9078,Have you ever stolen anything from a store or from someone?, I have stolen things from stores  when I was younger. It was like material things  eg a bra  a ring  a necklace lol. Not much though  don't go handing me over to the authorities please :) pleasssssssssssssse :D,Positive
9079,have you ever watched 'A guide to recognising your saints' ??, No I haven't. Any good? Whatever its about?,Positive
9080,have you ever wished that you had a different name?, Yes I have actually. I went through a phase when I loved South of Nowhere  and I wanted to be called Ashley LOL! Totally passed  and Im fine with Kelly now :),Positive
9081,have you ever worn lingerie? ;-), I have :P,Positive
9082,Have you ever: a) stayed overnight in hospital? b) had an operation? c) broken a bone? d) been unconscious? e) been in an ambulance?, Ummmm  I think all above for the previous question actually :(,Positive
9083,have you had any hetrosexual experiances?, You spelt it wrong. I think we covered that I had? Earlier :/,Positive
9084,Have you masturbated today? Fingers or toys? Butt plug?, HAHA! The uninteresting answer...no  no and no :P,Positive
9085,have you missed me?... i feel as though i've been a bit distant recently..., Yeah  I had noticed :( Any particular reason? Busy? :( I have missed you as a matter of fact  don't be distant :) and I wouldn't miss you so much. Sorted :D,Positive
9086,have you stopped answering questions?, I went to do other things :) aka tweet you all back ;),Positive
9087,Have your parents ever disapproved of any of your relationships?, Well  I have never really been in a serious relationship. Call it weird  but I never have. I pretty insecure about myself  so I don't have the confidence to approach or start talking to someone.  My parents don't approve about my sexuality though  so I never share anything with them about being in a relationship :),Positive
9088,having a good day? good weekend? looking forward to this week? or not? why for all 3 of the previous questions?... :-), No  No and the time from when I finish work  yes :) So the first and the second kind of rolled in to one really. Im having trouble dealing with something and  you know what that is  but its REALLY dragging me down. I don't know how to deal with it  and its actually driving me beyond insane :( Looking forward to next week  because its hopefully when I can do some stuff for me :),Positive
9089,having a good evening? ;-), Indeed I am... Are you? ;),Positive
9090,he works shifts  &&yes indeed i do know what it feels like., WHY?????? Who the hell hit you with a gold club?! :O,Positive
9091,HELLO  IS IT ME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?!, How did you guess? ;);),Positive
9092,hello again kelly did you miss me ?, It depends on who you are for me to have missed :P,Positive
9093,hell-O c-O c-O .. its all about the 'o's.. ok well it only slightly rhymes.. but it does.. kind of, Haha  okay  im getting it :) Sorry  I thought I was pronouncing words weird for a moment :S lol!,Positive

9095,helloooooo :-), Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii :) What happens if I take your nose? Can you deal with just a : and a )?,Positive
9096,hey coco ;-), Hey tee tee ;),Positive
9097,hey Kelly  it's Carla, YO YO CARLA!!! where have you been? 86'd yourself from being online :'(,Positive
9098,Hey Kelly., Helllllo? *waits for person to introduce themselves*,Positive

9101,Hi i'm Louise  we should bone sometime., HAHAHA! Hi Rosie :P,Positive
9102,Hi i'm Rosie  i like to give mixed signals and be a twat to my loved ones!!, I noticed Louise  Im with ya  totally :P,Positive
9103,hidden talents?, Hmmmm  I don't know whats hidden  but I have talents :) I have played the piano since I was about 7  the drums since I was 10  I came top of my school with my art and music grades and coursework. I completed one of the top pieces of work in my college course. Plus other things  but I don't want to continue and make you think I feel a lot about myself lol. I don't  Im just proud of some of my achievements :),Positive
9104,High bed  low bed? Small bed  large bed? Soft bed  hard bed? im reusing your randomness :-), Lowish bed  large bed  soft bed :) I prefer lower beds  only because it gives you more wall space that the bed is resting against. Which leaves more room to be creative and flow with personality :D,Positive
9105,high beds or low beds?, Low beds :) Im not a fan of big high ones  although they look more comfortable. Im a very modern person  and I like the ones that are lower  not on the floor  but ones that enable more wall space :),Positive
9106,hmm lets see  the prettiness and amazing eyes (which i havs just looked at for a while now on fb) would be only 2 of other reasons that id be staring at you (and its a good thing no one can read my mind ;-) haha..jk) .. and i like to stare.. observe..im.., haha! Well  no one can read your mind  but can you explain it??? ;) ;) lol! Or do I just need to use my imagination again? :P and thank you <3 :D,Positive
9107,hmm so you're falling for me?hmm i dont believe it..especially considering that there is nothing to fall for..im really a very boring plain and rather unattractive person..unlike yourself of course..you're the complete opposite of my unattractiveness..;-), I mayyy be ;) There is nothing to fall for? HUH?! lol! Have you seen you? Have you met you? Do you know you? Nope :P Obviously not...lol. There is everything to fall for  you are amazing  simples :) <3,Positive
9108,hmmm i wonder when your shift ends...? when do your shifts usually end?, It depends  but usually around 11:30/12 by the time I get home :( Sometimes earlier if I can blag my way out lol :P,Positive
9109,hmmm who do you miss? ;-), I just found this!!!!! WAHEY!!!!!! :D Well I have spoken to you since  but you just toodled off to bed  soooo  I miss you again :P I was anyway  so any way of me saying I didn't miss you would be me lying :P &quot;Hey! What do you mean! I didn't say that! Kelly mind is lying  this is Kelly's voice  just don't listen to her&quot; <<< No  Kelly voice is lying. You know me  im not going to deny it. MISSSSS YOUUUUUUU! (I think I have been drinking a bit too much :/ Hmmmmm.....) <33333333,Positive
9110,hmmmm did you miss me?, I DID! AND I DO!!!! :'(,Positive
9111,hmmmm questions..., Indeedo! I need to return the favour don't I? :),Positive
9112,hmmmm what to do till you get home... such a tough decision... grey's haha <3, Haha  its cute you have such an obsession with Greys <3,Positive
9113,hold on... cute in what way?, Cute cute :) There is nothing wrong with that :),Positive
9114,holy shit... do you realize that you have answered 884 questions (probly more after you answer this one)???... thats a lottt :-O  so congratz :-) do you also realize that your answers to these questions are keeping me ever so entertained :-D, Woahhhhhhhhh! Really? Thanks!  I wondered how you found that out  so I went onto my profile and couldn't see how you totaled that up  so I came to the conclusion that you added them up one by one ;) Then I scrolled down  and was disappointed that you hadn't :P haha!  Im glad im keeping you entertained :D You are keeping me entertained by asking them  so all in all we both win :),Positive
9115,home yet?, I think this was posted yesterday  so in which case  I am indeed :P,Positive
9116,Hot  cold  warm or cool?, Warm :),Positive
9117,hot or cold?, Leaning towards cold  but Im at a perfectly good temp thanks :),Positive
9118,how 'bout a 16 year old from somewhere else? ;-), hahahaha  its not the age. 16 year old  its not the age ;),Positive
9119,how 'bout now?? now??, YEAH!!! <33333 WOOOO FOR THE HOMENESS!!! :D,Positive
9120,How big is your bed?, Well its a double bed  and its quite a low one. Its about 1ft off the ground :) Its black and has leather sections. I <3 it! Everyone has said that my bed is comfy! Not that everyone has slept in it O_O I just mean friends :P lol,Positive
9121,How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another?, CLIMATE CHANGEEEE...ahem...I have no idea. Please  I would like to know the answer to that. Yesterday it was sunny (ish)  still cold  but the sun was out  today  PISS DOWN WITH RAINNNN! Odd...,Positive
9122,how can you think you're not hot... and you call me delusional??, Haha! Maybe we're both delusional :P Works out nicely then :),Positive
9123,How come you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead?, Because you don't know the battery is dead UNTIL you press harder :),Positive
9124,how comes you don't sleep?, Well  a little while ago  I started chatting online  and I was always up until very late hours of the morning speaking to them  only because I wanted to  no other reason. Well  I did it  continuously for several months  and now  whenever I try to go to bed earlier  (even if im absolutely shattered) I just can't get to sleep :( My sleeping pattern is REALLY messed up  and although I wouldn't go back to change it  I still need to sort something out  but I don't know what. I have been to the doctors about it  several times  and the final time  he eventually perscribed me some medication. Thing is  it was a pretty heavy dose of something that was VERY addictive and caused a lot of bad side effects. I started to take them  and they didn't make ay difference at all. I finished the packet  and they made no change to my sleeping that there wasn't a point in continuing and getting hooked on anything dangerous. So all in all  im pretty screwed :( I go to bed  perhaps 3am  but I don't get to sleep until about 5/6am and im normally woken up not long after with my family leaving to go to work. So I go back to sleep  im woken again  and this continues until I actually get up a few hours later.  I think this needs to be sorted :( I need my life back :'(,Positive
9125,How coool it was to meet Kathryn and Lily ?<3, Beyond cool! They are such normal people though  nothing has gone to their heads  and you can imagine them being friends rather than someone famous and as a result intimidating :) A bit of a blur though...,Positive
9126,how did u family react to u likeing girls ?, Well mum has since tried to set me up with guys  and she constantly talks about me &quot;happily married with my husband&quot;  so she is still in that denial phase. Not good when I initially told her. My dad  has forgotten I think  either that or he didn't take it seriously in the first place. If im honest  to me  my parents have nothing to do with my sexuality  its my issue  my life :),Positive
9127,how did u know u liked girls, My friends used to talk about boys  and I never felt anything they were describing until I realised  everything they were saying  for me applied to certain girls :/ In the beginning  mainly odd celebrities  but once I was open to it and I had tuned in  I realised it could be anyone (not necessarily famous) :),Positive
9128,how different they are...hmmm odd :-P, LOADS! Its weird  why can't we all have the same system? That would make it so much easier :),Positive
9129,how do you act when you're angry (like are you the 'silent treatment' person or do you just have to yell a bit.. or something else?)?, Hmmm  it depends on what it was. I am one of those people who stay quiet for a while then kind of explode a bit :S It really depends on who I was with and whether I would feel comfortable talking things out  you know? Hopefully it would involve exploding that way :),Positive
9130,how do you act when.. you're in love? <333, Im really smitten with that person  and I give everything I possibly could to that person to make them feel as special as I do for being with them :) As you know by now  Im a romantic kind of person  so I would give everything I had into it :) Other than that  pretty damn happy when Im with them  and really mopey when I miss them :'(,Positive
9131,how do you act when.. you're sad? :'-(, Thats when I go quiet  definitely. I probably give pretty short answers too  its usually easy to tell (if you know me well enough) that I am upset about something. Either that  or I come ranting to you <3,Positive
9132,how do you choose between your head and your heart, I don't know im afraid. Some people follow their heart  some people their head. I guess it all depends on which you think will work out best.,Positive
9133,how do you find the up side when everything is down?, I just look for things that make me happy or I can escape to :) No matter how bad things can get  there is always something that can cheer you up. So I guess its about concentrating on those things? :),Positive
9134,how do you get over a big loss  thats really killing you?, I don't know Im afraid :( I guess time can heal anything? right? :(,Positive
9135,How does it feel knowing so many girls want you?, The don't. You have just been mistaken :),Positive
9136,How does it feel knowing you have stalkers? ;), I have stalkers?,Positive
9137,how does the UK school/education system work?? its different from the US... now this is a boring question..., Okay  so basically. When we start education (at about 4/5 years) we start primary school  which goes from reception  then year one  through to year 6 (all completed yearly). Then  we go to secondary school  starting in year 7 (age 10/11) all the way through to year 11 (15/16). In years 3  6 and 9  we complete 'SATS' which are like little test things determining how well we are doing in school. In year 11  we complete our GCSE's  which are the qualifications that a lot of employees look at when interviewing you. Then we finished school and go to college to study a-levels for 2 years  generally before people go onto university to study a chosen subject at age 17/18 for a final degree. How about yours? Its always confused me :P lol,Positive
9138,how early do you get up in the morning?, Hmmm  it depends day to day  generally on when I fall to sleep. Perhaps 11:30 or something? But I wake up before  and just lie there lol!,Positive
9139,How far would you go with someone that you just met? haha ;-), hahaha! These questions today :P If im honest  im not one of those people who would sleep with anyone and everyone there and then. I like to get to know people before  lets say 'getting intimate' with them. Its hard to say  because you connect differently with different people  and I think you can judge a lot from a first meeting  so it completely depends on the person and my feelings for them :),Positive
9140,how in the hell are you still single?!, Lol  thank you!!! You tell me? What's wrong with me? There must be a reason right? Perhaps its the insecure issue :( lol <33333,Positive
9141,How is the weather right now? i mean obviously its night.. but aside from that.. can you see the moon and stars? :-), I don't have a clue! Its dark  and all the blinds are closed. Im not walking outside by myself to check  unless you join me? :P,Positive
9142,How is the weather right now?, Well we have had a lot of rain the past couple of days  but for now  its steady :) Still wet and cold out though :(,Positive
9143,How late do you usually go to sleep?, Ummm  well I go to bed any time from about 3 until 5  and im usually asleep at about 6/7? I suffer from REALLY bad insomnia  hence why Im always up late at night  and why I normally sleep on in the day :),Positive
9144,How many did I ask? :-P Hahaha., I think it was about 40/50? lol!  but my Twitter update limit ran out in between  so im answering all now :D,Positive
9145,How many floors does your home have?, 2 floors :) Well three if you include the loft :/,Positive
9146,How many in your family? How many siblings do you have? Are you the oldest or the youngest of those siblings?, I actually have a really small family. In my close family  its me  my sister (who is 23) and our parents. Then I have one gran  2 uncles  one aunt and 2 cousins. Although I hardly see both of my uncles  they aren't really bothered about keeping in contact with the family  so eventually we have sort of lost touch :( I haven't seen one of my cousins for about 4/5 years. He got married  and ended up forgetting about his own family to move in on his wifes family and friends. So basically  that leaves my nan  cousin and aunt are the only people I really see. Its pretty sad :( My cousin  her dad (one of the uncles) also treated her really badly as a child (deliberately left her out of things  made her eat at a separate table over dinner  sent her to bed when she did nothing wrong  wouldn't let her go outside etc) so its another reason why the family don't worry about the uncle excusing himself from the family.  Both of my other grandparents have passed away :( Grampy when I was 3  Nan when I was 5 (and I still remember that :'() and 'Pop' (grandfather) when I was 15. So  a pretty small loose family unit I would say :(,Positive
9147,How many languages can you speak and what are they?, Well I studied French and German at school  but I have forgotten pretty much all of it. I would like to speak French and Spanish fluently though  I have just never gotten around to learning them properly :),Positive
9148,how many more questions do you have to answer  i bet you'll be here all night?, 46 in total..lol. I also promised someone else LOADDDDSSSS to make up for all these. So yes  all night :),Positive
9149,how many pairs of pyjamas do you own?, Umm  2 pairs I think. Im not a pyjama person  I tend to wear jogging bottoms or shorts with t-shirts and tank tops depending on the weather :) If its REALLLLLLY cold  then a hoodie too  and really hot  then a tank top and pants? lol,Positive
9150,How many questions did I ask this time? (not including the multiple questions in a question) How many questions are you going to ask me in return? :-P, Hmmm  I think you asked about 15/20? Its about fair I do the same right? :D,Positive
9151,How many sex toys do you own? :), ..............,Positive
9152,How many sugars do you put in tea?, I don't put sugar in my tea :) I use sweetener though  like 3 :),Positive
9153,How many sugars in your tea?, No sugar. Just sweetner. Depends on the size of mug :) On average  perhaps 12 ;),Positive
9154,How many times can you use the word  lame???, As many times as I can say &quot;Asshole&quot;...,Positive
9155,How many times have you been 'surfed and turfed' ?, Oh Lordy!!!,Positive
9156,How many times have you been on a plane?, Too many times :S 2/3 times (plus return) a year?,Positive
9157,How many times have you been to the beach?, Too many :S I don't even like the beach that much  thats why it's too many. The first time I ever stepped foot on a beach  I burst out crying because I didn't like the sand between my toes LOL! I was rather young though  so cut me some slack :P,Positive
9158,how much for a pint and a poke?, Stop using Skins quotes :P,Positive
9159,How oddly similar are we? :-D, I think we're very similar :) I mean we agree on a lot of things  and have the same personality traits. Obviously Im slightly older than you are  but we still have a lot in common. Our views and values appear to be the same too  along with our priorities in life :) You are a slightly late version of me HAHA!,Positive
9160,How often *would you like to* go out on dates?, I don't know really. Im not one of those people that NEEDS to go out to have a good time. Sure  I Would like to go out with my partner  but staying in  cuddling up watching a good movie is just as nice :) It all depends on what mood im in (not  like that ;) lol) and if there was somewhere I really wanted to go. Im pro originality lol  do something different than your average 'dinner date' :),Positive
9161,How often do you eat food?, Whenever I get hungry I suppose.,Positive
9162,How often do you really go out?, Go out? In the sense leave my house? lol Probably every day  unless im ill or something :(,Positive
9163,How old are you?  I was just wondering..., 20 and a half :),Positive
9164,how old are you?, 20 :),Positive
9165,how old do you feel most of the time?, I guess I just feel my age  I don't know how it feels to feel old  so I suppose 20?,Positive
9166,how old do you want to be when you die?, Depends on how wrinkly I get. No pre 80s shit though :) If Im one of those old ladies still able to line-dance and pee by themselves  Im all for the old age!,Positive
9167,How old were you when you had your first girlfriend/boyfriend?, Thats kind of hard to answer actually. Remember 'Time for Coffee?'  my fanfic? Well  that was based on something I had with a girl from work  so its hard to say really. Technically we weren't dating  but there was obviously something there.,Positive
9168,How old were you when you went on your first date? How was it?, I have never really been taken on a date lol. Call it sad  but Im not a big one for relationships and I have never had anything serious  so the term 'date' hasn't been big in my life :(,Positive
9169,How romantic are you?, I would like to think im pretty romantic. I don't think you need much to be romantic or spontaneous  its just about being original and making something special for the other half.,Positive
9170,How tall are you?, 5'11&quot; :) Pretty tall  hence not being able to wear heels :P Hey  at least it means im usually stable :D,Positive
9171,How the fuck do you own 30 pairs of jeans?!, Oh trust me  thats nothing! You should see my entire wardrobe :S Im such a girl when it comes to clothing lol. 30 pairs of jeans? Well  I don't even wear jeans  so if i'm honest  its completely pointless in owning them.,Positive
9172,how was you're day?, Hmmm  not great :( Argument with mum  bust day. Went to the hairdresser again  they are bleaching my hair strand again  and Im popping back tomorrow. So yeah  from mother angst and work  haven't actually stopped all day :( Anywayyy  im home  and here to relax now :) How was yours? <3,Positive
9173,how was your day? <3, It was okay thanks :) Managed to get out of work earlier than expected  so that was nice :) Not the most eventful days  but it could have been worse :) Im sorry to have heard about yours :'(,Positive
9174,how was your evening without me? well im back now so technically not 'without me'  but before i got back? haha :-), Well it wasn't too great. Apart from feeling REALLY terrible  I have had a few problems over twitter (most of which I have told you over a question  near the end I think). I have been being driven slightly insane  but you're going to find out why in a bit :) Anyway  im off to bed  so I shall speak to a certain someone tomorrow! Until then  I SHALL MISS YOUUUUU :( Sleep well when you go to bed :D <333,Positive
9175,How weird am i???? pretty weird right?? ;-p haha, You're not weird :) No one is weird  someone can be different  but never weird :) Depends on who you are as to how 'different' you are ;),Positive
9176,How would you ask someone out?, Im not really the person who does the asking out  if im completely honest. I don't have very much self confidence (as you should know from reading my answers already)  so its not a move I would generally do. I leave it up to the other person  hence why I am probably still single lol. I could ask them out to do something  but I wouldn't strictly say &quot;want to go for coffee?&quot; type of ask out  that just isn't me :),Positive
9177,HOW YOU BEEN KELLY!?!?!, LOUISE!!!!!! Missssssed you :( I am Kelly! How do you think I have been? :D and how is theeeee? :),Positive
9178,http://www.facebook.com/pages/Shed/302480541294?ref=ts, I just joined :) I WANT TO SEE SHED!!! :D,Positive

9180,hug me?, I think you deserve a hug now  after all the looking after you have done tonight! *grabs you and holds you tight  squeezing you (not too hard) but enough to know that im here and not going anywhere  ever* :),Positive
9181,hugs or massages?, Hugs :) But both are nice  hugs include the other person too though :),Positive
9182,i am memorizing the entire human anatomy... not for school  but for fun..., For fun? Hell yeah! Go for it brain box ;) shall I test you? :P,Positive

9192,i cant stop crying... :'-(, &quot;I try to stop  but it doesn't work. You don't expect things to happen. So Im at this stupid open day  and...&quot; you know where this is going :P But all stupidness aside :( I read your last question and its about Skins and Greys? :( BIG HUGGGGGSSSSSSSSSSSsSS <333333,Positive
9193,i couldnt tell you  because what happens in the shed stays in the shed. but nothing happens in the shed  so its cool., All in all. There is no shizzle to tell then.,Positive
9194,I don't know what it means  ask Carla., Aren't you asking me the question? Shouldn't you ask Carla to find out your own results?,Positive
9195,i dont microwave ice cream  i suck it but yeah sure., You suck ice cream? Aren't you supposed to lick it? O-O,Positive

9197,i enjoy asking you questions  hey it works again!!!!!!, IT WORKSSSSS XD I enjoy answering them :),Positive
9198,i feel like ive been re-asking you questions... or asking you questions that are similar to one that ive asked you before... am i? :-P, Probably :P I mean its hard to come up with 12 hundred questions that are different right?

9201,i HATE geese crap... >:-Z (<angry face.. fyi), HAHA! I must admit  im not a fan of any crap  geese or no geese :P,Positive
9202,i hate it when you're crying and someone just looks at you and says ;oh just stop it  thats stupid'.. no fucking hug.. no 'oh there-there  it'll be alright' or 'thats it  just net it alll out'... no nothing.. :'-(, Oh me tooooooooooo! I remember when I started crying in one of my managers offices and they were just sat there like &quot;..........&quot;. Its like  &quot;no  this isn't embarrassing at all. Just sit there and stare&quot;. I was going through a hard patch  hence crying in the first place lol. But  in actual response to yours  Im not like that :) If someone is crying  I would do my best to comfort them  and that of course includes you <3,Positive
9203,i have a 7 page essay due tomorrow...:-(, :( Better get writing. I have an idea! Just write REALLY big :) Sortedddddd...that may have been what I did during school ;),Positive

ALL WEEKEND... :-) i went to the beach today  and was thinking about how i wished you were there with me... it was gorgeous..<3, Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Well I wish I was there too :) I haven't had the greatest weekend in history  and I would have loved to have been there :) Probably would have chosen there over anywhere else ever actually! See  feel special :P  I missed you too :( Will you be around to talk soon? <33333,Positive
9225,i miss you already... and its only been an hour..., Awwwww! I miss you too :( Im going to miss you lots today too  seeing as I have the crapfest of waitressing tonight :'''( Come and save me? Thanks :D Ohhh  and I had another dream last night! Which  I am glad to say you weren't in this one :S It was HORRRRRRRIBLE!!!!!!!!  So  it started off  I was in this really historic City  something like Prague  and I was with my sister. We saw this dog running around  crying out because half of its belly's skin had been ripped off!!! IT had blood ALL over it  but no one could catch the dog to take it to the vets. Anyway  I eventually managed to get it  and my sister (trainee vetinary nurse) was taking a look at him. Then I saw a manager from work  and I don't know how  but I just knew that he had done it. I spoke to him  and he was like &quot;I found this machine  that latches on to a piece of skin  then you pull the handle and it rips it off&quot;. I went HYSTERICAL and was asking what the fuck he thinks he was doing.  So then I ended up at home somehow  and the dog was at the vets Im guessing (i don't know where it went) and then I was reading up about this machine. It said that people who work nights  they used this machine on them (to remove all their skin) so that they weren't able to work in the day  and so outside people could tell the difference between night and day workers (WTF?!?!?!?!) lol. So anyway  I was really freaked out that my manager was going to come and get us (because I lost it on him about the dog) and I told my family  but they didn't really seem to believe me. So time went on  and I was sat in my room  and my sister and mum were randomally led in my bed  really scared. My manager got into the house and eventually attacked my mum. I lost it and grabbed a massive kitchen cake knife thing. I lunged at him  and started attacking his arms to get him to let go of my mum. He did  then he started trying to stab me  all while I kept slicing his arms with this knife. Eventually I went for it  and I slashed his throat!!! He didn't stop  so I had to do it again  a bit deeper. That still didn't stop him  so I started sawing at his neck to cut his head off. Nothing. He was still cutting my arms with his knife thing  so I kicked him to the floor and pushed down all of my weight onto the blade and eventually cut his head clean off!!!! Then he started laughing (even though his head was detached) and said about a bomb that he planted would be going off right about now and we had no time to get out. So we lost. I had a &quot;SHITTTTTT!&quot; moment  and me and my dad were trying to get my family out of the house  then I woke up....So im guessing I would have exploded??? O_O So yeah  im glad you weren't in that one :) Can I have a hug please? That wasn't nice :'''''''(,Positive

9250,I still cant believe you know Georgia... and you've met the skins cast... :-O anyone else i should know about? who was your favorite to meet? who was the nicest(&who wasnt)? who was absolutely nothing like you expected them to be like? who was the cutest?, Ummm  I don't think so lol. Saw Simon Cowell about a month ago. Ermmmm  the nicest people? Well I am obviously biased  but I think I would Say Lily  with Kat close behind :) Lily is SOOOO down to earth  and I Really could imagine myself being good friends with her in real life. As for Kat  she was lovely too  but Kat has a VERY cool exterior  and because she gets a REAL lot of people talking to her  she has a lot to deal with  you know what I mean? When I met Kaya  I didn't actually like her. Both times :( the first time  I was outside the cinema  and Luke  Kat  Lily and Kaya were just going in. I called out &quot;Kat!&quot; and she looked around  really shocked! LOL! Then I spoke to them  and Kaya shouted &quot;come on! The film has already started!&quot; and Lily followed her inside the theater. Luke and Kat were stood there  and we were all just looking at each other  not knowing what to do. I said &quot;don't worry. ITs okay  enjoy your film&quot; and Both Luke and Kat looked at each other  replying &quot;no no no&quot; and walked back over to me :D I LOVED IT! That was SUCH a nice feeling! Knowing they were missing their film to come and talk to me! So anyway  I spoke to Luke first  then I started talking to Kat and Luke went on inside. Then I was saying how much I loved Emily  etc etc etc (crazy fangirl behaviour lol) and she said thanks  did a cute thumbs up thing  I said bye  and she did a cute wave. She was adorable then! Anyway  the second time I met Kaya  it was at the Skins House. She had been in the VIP area upstairs ALL night  and she had just come down  for about 5 minutes. I saw her  and walked over asking for a photo. She was talking to someone  so I just stood there and patiently waited. Then she stopped  and I tapped her on the shoulder. Nothing. So she started talking to someone else. I waited until she finished  and tapped again. Nothing. Then she started talking again  I waited  tapped again. Nothing. So I started saying &quot;kaya?&quot;  nothing. Said it again  nothing :( Then she started to walk away  up some stairs  back into the VIP room  and she was running up pretty fast so I couldn't follow :( Later on  I saw her again  and I asked her to sign my magazine cover. She said yes  and then she had just signed a 'k' and then someone walked into her  causing her to smudge the pen/marker. At this point  she hasn't even signed half her name  but she just said 'sorry' and walked off  leaving me stood there with a magazine with the entire cast's signatures on  and a 'k' over Kaya's photo. I wasn't too impressed if im honest  especially because I wasn't being pushy :( anyway  I did eventually manage to get a quick photo with her  but it was a bit of a job to get there :( Hmm  the cutest? Probably Meg :) She has quite low self asteem actually! When I met her at the filming  she was just sat by herself  watching the filming. Then we went over and started chatting to her  and she was saying how she had been there 10 hours and they hadn't even used her in anything yet :( Then we had a photo with her  and looking back at it  she was like &quot;OMG! I look terrible!&quot; even though she looked adorable :) Then there was when I met her at the house party. She was pretty sweet then too. I think she was a bit nervous actually because in the beginning  she was walking around holding Lukes hand and it was just so sweet to see :) Then  she went outside and was smoking practically the entire night lol. She was a drowned little rat! She was drenched! But still looked adorable :),Positive

As much as I love Katie being her confident cocky side  it was nice to see her actually fragile for a while. I know she was in Ep 9 of last season  but that was different. She actually felt vunerable  and all I was routing for  is the &quot;Katie fucking Fitch&quot; back :P It will be interesting to see how she is in the next few episodes. Considering she doesn't think she is 'her' anymore  she is having an identity crisis  and I would like to see how that pans out :),Positive

9312,if i were to call you by a nickname... what nickname would you want me to call you? :-P, You can call me anything you wanted to :D Apart from KellBell  Kelly Belly  Smelly Kelly  Kelly welly... I don't love those names  and why does my name have to rhyme with so many insults :'( lol,Positive
9313,If it's zero degrees outside today and it's supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow  how cold is it going to be?, FREAKING DAMN COLD! But it's already freezing  so im going to say  freezing ice. :/,Positive
9314,If Jimmy cracks corn and no one cares  why is there a song about him?, Who is Jimmy? :/ The only one I can think of is Marissa's dad in The OC lol,Positive
9315,If money were not an object  what would you do with your life?, I would do anything that enables me and my family/friends to be happy. Whatever that meant  I would do it :),Positive
9316,If one song were to describe your life  which song would that be?, Ermmmm  I have NO clue. My life has taken many turns and gone to many different places  so I don't think I could pick any :/ You can take elements from lots of different songs  its all about thinking about how they relate to you. Most songs relate to most people  its just about linking them :),Positive
9317,If people from Poland are called Poles  why aren't people from Holland called Holes?, &quot;Hey holes! How you guys doing?!&quot; &quot;we got lost!&quot; &quot;Oh shit  why was that?&quot; &quot;Because hole over the there is too fat  and we all fell down&quot; lol! :P,Positive
9318,If Pinocchio said  u201cMy nose is about to growu201d  what would happen?, I for one  would dart out of the way and look at him side on.

9325,If the world was flat  would you go up to the precipice just to see what was over the edge?, Hmmmm  I think there was a bit of a give away then. The edge  is boring. Deal with it ;),Positive
9326,If we believed that life wanted more than anything else to simply serve our hearts dersires   asking on a daily basis -how do you want to be loved today - how would you reply?, The think with romance  I think something that can kill the spontaneity in a relationship  is asking your partner &quot;What should we do? How can I make you happy? Tell me and I will do it&quot;. Apart from the obvious answer that makes most people happy ;) its not romantic to tell someone how you want to be treated. I would feel much better  if my partner made an effort and figured it out. Even if they didn't figure out exactly what I wanted to do  I would love them that much more for making the effort to show me that they love me. Does this make sense?,Positive
9327,If you add your username to your ignore list  would you not be able to read your own posts?, Why would I read my own posts anyway? :P I post them  so there is no point in reading them back  because I already know what they say ;),Positive

9329,if you could 'walk in someone else's shoes' for a day  who's would you walk in?, Ummmm  someone who I would like to try living like perhaps? No one too famous  although I would like to see how feel feels like without having to deal with a lifetime of it. Ummm  I don't know. No one scarily eccentric :S Actually thinking about it  I would like to be Kathryn Prescott for a day :P I would love to know how it feels to have that female attention ;) LOL!,Positive
9330,If you could be a bird  which bird would you choose to be and why?, Ermmmm  a parrot? Because we learn to speak! Which makes us intelligent  and a cross human...soooo. I like being a human  so thats the best way to go :) Besides  I WOULD BE PRETTY!!! WOOP! lol,Positive
9331,If you could BE any Skins character  who would you be and why?, Well  I would say that I am VERY similar to Emily at the moment  and I really hate being so sensitive about things. I would say Naomi  DEFINITELY  because she can cut things off  and basically doesn't give a shit. Im jealous of her ability to do that :(,Positive
9332,if you could be anywhere in the world right now  where would you be?, Ummm  its really cold here  so somewhere warm at least :) In bed  all warm and cosy <3333333,Positive
9333,if you could be born in any time period/era  when would you choose be born?, Now :) Because things seem to be getting better as time goes on. Technology  culture  social acceptance etc etc etc  and also  now is the time where Sexuality isn't so much of a big deal  and I like that. Sooooo  now :),Positive
9334,If you could change one thing that happened last year what would it be?, Hmmmm. Probably dying my hair red. Unoriginal  but who cares :),Positive

9336,If you could have a super-power  what super-power would it be? why? :-), Hmmm  the power to turn invisible? Then I would go all Veronica Mars on unsuspecting victims... Orrrrrr The power to read minds. Not scarily like 'Earshot' from Buffy  but be able to home in on one person  and turn it off it I wanted. There goes all insecurity right? :D No more fake friends. Although  the truth can hurt. Okay  lets go back to the invisible one :),Positive
9337,If you could have any animal as a pet  what would you have?, A BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN :D,Positive
9338,if you could kiss anyone in the world right now and they would fall in love with you from that single kiss  who would you kiss?, I DONT CARE IF THIS ISNT POSSIBLE! Emily Fitch :) lol. No  I don't mean Kathryn Prescott  I mean Emily Fitch XD lol.,Positive
9339,If you don't recognize the number on your caller ID  do you answer?, NO lol! Its always someone trying to sell something  and do I really need to listen to that?,Positive
9340,If you feel stressed what would you do to reduce it?, It depends what the stress is over. If its a fight with a person  or im angry at them for whatever reason  I normally throw something at the wall lol!!

NEXT!&quot; :D lol,Positive
9342,If you got in a cab and the driver drove backwards  would he end up owing you money? :-D, Well unless he is planning on taking you around the world the long way  then he owes you the money yeah! Actually  they should do that! It would be a free fare and still get you home!,Positive
9343,If you had a billion dollars  what would you do with it?, Woahhh? A billion dollars? Well  I would make sure I am settled with everything I would need  plus my family and friends. Then I would give a lot to charities  to smaller charities  because the mainstream ones get a lot from exposure  then put the rest into an account for future family members. I wouldn't want to be that kind of person where it changes who I am. But still  I wouldn't mind it ;),Positive
9344,If you had one word to describe yourself   what would you choose?, Independent :),Positive
9345,If you had to choose between a millions bucks and being able to fly  which would you choose?, A million bucks. Because what can you really achieve by flying?  1) you would look extremely odd 2) With a million bucks you can buy flying equipment :),Positive
9346,If you had to choose between your favourite chocolate bar  your favourite type of crisps (chips to everyone else) and your favourite drink as the ONLY thing you could ever enjoy again - what would it be and why? Oh and please tell us what your favs are!, Ummmm  chocolate bar <333 Also  I heard you can lose weight if you eat only chocolate? Thats a bonus right? haha! So yeah  chocolate.

9349,If you try to fail  and succeed  which have you done?, You have failed...pure and simple...so as a result  succeeded :),Positive
9350,If you were a genie and a person asked you this wish  I wish you would not grant me this wish  what would you do?, They cancel each other out  so I do nothing...use it on myself instead :) Im a hardcore genie  I bent rules...,Positive
9351,If you were a tree  what tree would you be?? :-P, A tree? Well  I wasn't aware that trees can tell the difference between things  but I see where you are going with this. I would say a Willow tree  only because I love to be protective of the ones that I love  and as a Willow  I can spread my branches and give shelter to those who need it :) (EXCUSE CHEESY ANSWER  thanks ;)),Positive
9352,If you were the opposite sex for one day  what would you look like and what would you do?, Ermmmmm  can't say I have ever thought about that question. So  I would say beefy like Mr T!! Phwarrrrrr! ;) and go around giving out free chocolate bars for sex ;) HAHA!,Positive
9353,If you were under house arrest and you lived in a mobile home  wouldn't you be able to go anywhere you want? :-D, You would  but you would never be able to leave it. So  its a bit like  the &quot;you can look  but don't touch rule&quot;....IT PLAIN SUCKS!,Positive

9355,If your friend was cheating on their lover  would you tell them to stop?, I don't think it would really be my place to get involved  but it would completely depend on their lover. If I thought  they treated my friend badly in the first place  I probably would just stay out of it  whereas if they didn't deserve it  I would try and intervene and tell my friend to sort herself out  and tell them  or break it off. It's not fair to lie either way :(,Positive
9356,IM A HERO! will you be my heroine?, Im already a heroine ;),Positive
9357,im a question theif.. its my new thing ;-), I certainly did think so :P So  can I become a major role in your new  business? PLease? Can I be the executive manager and steal some too? :),Positive

You are the only person that I know who regularly keeps them updated :) My nails are painted now? Of course they are! I can't remember a day when I went out without painted nails :P They are a dark red colour :) They usually are to be honest :),Positive
9363,im going shopping this weekend... care to join me? :-), I Would LOVE to join you :) Well thanks! Can I spend all my money on nice clothes and take you to dinner? :P haha,Positive
9364,im good  missed you though.. haha good day?, Awwwwww  I missed you too (didn't want to be soppy and admit it though  but I clearly failed ;)) Pretty boring day  but there again  you weren't here  so what do I expect? :P Anything fun happen at school? :),Positive

9368,Imagine. It is a dark night  you are alone  it is raining outside  you hear someone walking around outside your window. Who do you call?, Can I call the local butchers? They are bound to have some utensils that come in handy in case im attacked ;) haha,Positive
9369,In Cali  Colombia  a woman may only have sex with her husband and the first time this happens  her mother must be a witness. :-O :-( ewww/eeeek, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! I just loled!!! Is that serious?! HOW AWFUL!!! I take it its an arranged marriage or something random? HAHA! POOR BLOKE TOO!  Thats worse than dying a virgin LOL,Positive
9370,in general opinion on motorbikes? mopeds? good bad? fun? comment in any way... ;-), I think they can be fun BUT the only worry I have about them  is some people don't wear the right gear and I get a bit concerned about that. Especially if its people that I really care about or love :( I do think they are pretty fun though  and my sister did have a moped before she learned to drive a car. She gave it up about 2 weeks into passing her test lol! So apart from being concerned  they are rather cool :D,Positive
9371,In Katie's episode of series 4 we learnt that Katie's name is actually Kathryn (might not be spelt that way but it's all good). So when I asked who came first Kathryn or Kathryn...?, Ohhhhh  I get it! Well  Kathryn thats a rather trick question isn't it :P Because its both :P Katie  and Kat :),Positive
9372,In scale from 1-10  how afraid of dark are you?, Depends on where I am. In my bedroom  like 2  in the woods  about 9 :),Positive
9373,In your opinion  what is the best thing about being a girl? :-), Ummm  probably kind of the same as the last answer  in a weird way. Sensitivity? Only because  being a girl and someone doing something for you  either a friend  family member or a lover  you appreciate it so much more. Also  being a girl (this is going to sound terrible) but you are able to handle things better  and are able to understand how a certain person is feeling or thinking  and you can react to it in the right way. If that makes sense? Men  again some  not all  are less sensitive  and don't understand why that person is crying or angry  but being a girl. You just know :),Positive
9374,In your opinion  what is the worst thing about being a girl?, Well apart from the obvious  having children  the pain of giving birth  periods  etc etc. Sensitivity I think. Just because  I know im a very sensitive person  and I really hate how I let things upset me sometimes. A lot of men  not all  but the majority  don't let things bother them so much as women do. So definitely that :(,Positive
9375,independent but you live at home... explain?, Well I am independent in the sense that I don't care what other people think (about certain things anyway) and I don't let anything else influence what I wear or say.  A lot of people say my dress sense is &quot;unique&quot; and I would agree lol. I still live at home  only because I have no other choice. Im only 20  and you will see what its like to be still pretty young and not have the biggest income. If I moved out  I would be paying rent for somewhere  but I couldn't even afford to live. So whats the point in moving out? I will in time  well in september. So its going to be a nice break :) When I am at home  im independent in the sense that I like to be in my bedroom or by myself doing things (not that Im a loner lol) I just find it easier to concentrate on something if no one else is there. You know what I mean? I sound completely weird don't I??? O_O lol!,Positive
9376,inny or an outy?, Inny,Positive
9377,inny or outy., Inny :) You?,Positive
9378,is anything really ever perfect? :-(, Well  what is perfect? I suppose that determines our answer :) There isn't such a thing  its different to the individual. But I suppose  no :(,Positive
9379,is curiosity ever a bad thing?, Never. Curiosity keeps you alive :) It keeps things entertaining...,Positive
9380,Is family important to you?, YES! Definitely! I think family is very much  what you can make of it  but still. They are the people that have lived to bring you up  you need to respect and be thankful for that  even if I don't get along with them all the time.,Positive
9381,Is forever over now?, Forever will never be over...,Positive
9382,Is having a crush on john bishop wrong?Lol :-P, Totally not! Only if you have a crush on his on screen daughters  then yes. Fuck it   John Bishop is totally hot! Not to me  obviously  but in general XD,Positive
9383,is it always obvious that im asking you the questions?, Onlt a tad ;) haha <3,Positive
9384,Is it just me or is it weird watching people do ski jumping?, Its interesting...for about 5 seconds  then I switch the channel :P,Positive
9385,Is it just me that crys when they yawn?, I cry when I yawn. Its bloody annoying when you have just done your make-up :S,Positive
9386,is it ok to have a crush on multiple people?, I think so yeah  as long as you don't ACT on that crush with multiple people  or tell your other half about the crushes  than you're fine (don't want to make things awkward :S). Well  unless its a celebrity one  because I think everyone has them lol.,Positive
9387,is it possible to be cute and drop dead gorgeous?, Yes I think so  definitely! well  yourself for one thing :P Don't even go there by saying you arent! If you saw yourself in a bar  you would SO chat yourself up  don't even deny it :P,Positive
9388,is it wrong that im working my way through a tub of carte dor?, No  why is it wrong? The only problem  is that its French :P JOKE!,Positive
9389,is it wrong to like boys ?, no lol. Thats like saying is it wrong to like tea :/,Positive
9390,is it wrong to like girls ?, No. Unless you are some type of insect  then sorry to say  it probably wont work. Size issues you know?,Positive
9391,Is it?, Of course.,Positive
9392,is love eternal?, I would like to think so yes :),Positive
9393,Is revenge sometimes justified?, Yes. I think so yes  in different ways too. If someone gets you  why can't you return the favour? I think revenge  can show people something too  if that makes sense? Shows you how something feels. Take Naomily for example  Emily kissing that girl  it showed Naomi (in a really small sense) how Emily is feeling  even though it doesn't compare  Emily blatantly did it on purpose to get back at her  and I would probably do the same in her position. So  yes  I think it can be :),Positive
9394,IS ROSIE ASLEEP?!, &quot;Rosie? Are you asleep?&quot; &quot;yes...&quot; Yeah she is sorry...,Positive
9395,Is the glass half empty or half full?, Half full. Why be negative about it :),Positive
9396,Is there a such thing as a perfect relationship for you?, Ummm  I think the term 'perfect relationship' varies for everyone and anyone depending on their mood at the time. You know? If I were to answer this  I would say someone who loved me for who I was  and vice versa. Someone who gets you  who unterstands your feelings and needs  and treats you with the respect you treat them with. Someone romantic  cute  witty  honest  trusting etc lol. how about you?,Positive
9397,is there anywhere more secluded where you will post the answers that escape this form?, Not that im aware of.,Positive
9398,Is this THE KELLY BLAKE  the one that was in skins?! r BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Hey lester buddy ;)r  r This was me (louise) buddy ;) haha. ONIT., ONIT!,Positive
9399,Is this THE KELLY BLAKE  the one that was in skins?!, BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Hey lester buddy ;),Positive
9400,Is your hair naturally curly?, It is naturally quite wavy yes :) It goes REALLY curly if it gets wet when im out or something  and I hate it when It gets rained on  because I can't sort it out until I am back home :( Anyway  normally I don't really do much to my hair. I always blow dry it  kind of so it goes a messy wavy kind of look. I don't use any straightners or curlers on it (very often anyway) I just let it do its thannnnng :) Probably why it is in such good condition then :) I style it occasionally obviously  but more often than not  its left messy :) But like styled messy  not like  trampy or anything LOL!,Positive
9401,Is your hair soft?, It is actually :) I remember when I went to the hairdressers to actually ask about bleaching my hair  and they said &quot;but your hair is so soft and shiny! Don't ruin it!&quot; But its better than doing it when its weak and it falling out lol! So yeah  it is pretty glossy :),Positive
9402,Is your middle finger longer than your ring finger?, Its actually not  because then my hand would look scary ;),Positive
9403,Is your middle name as cool as Carla's?, Carla's middle name will always be cool to you because its personal. Mine  is cool to anyone else who is named Annabel :P,Positive
9404,Isn't it interesting how the word politics is made up of the words poli meaning many in Latin  and tics as in bloodsucking creatures?, 'Many tics'...explains the story behind 'the parliment' then ;) lol,Positive
9405,It doesn't like you., Does this face look like it cares? To me  this face looks like it's smiling...,Positive
9406,It is more worthwhile and satisfying to improve the world or appreciate the world?, Appreciate the world. To change something is a HECK of a big deal  and its not always achievable  which means you would never be satisfied. So  to appreciate it the way it is  means you would always get something out of it :),Positive
9407,IT MEANS NOTHING TO ME ANYMORE BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO I SHED TALKED WITH IS BEING A C U N T !! LIKE NORMAL I SUPPOSE  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PERSON IN THE SHED AY AY AY!?!?!, I think you and Rosie need to sort this out  or I think you and Louise need to sort this out Without the use of these questions...,Positive
9408,it's bum with warm milk  But maybe this is because i dont like milk., You don't like milk? Who doesn't like milk? If you were lactose intolerant  then fair enough  but considering you are having milk on your cereals  I guess you aren't?,Positive

9420,just fell up the stairs... then tripped over a bucket  only to land face first in my cats' litter box... which has not been cleaned in a while... my uncoordinatedness has absolutely noooo boundaries... :-P, OMFG! Did you actually just do that?! HAHAHAHA! If I fell in my cats litter tray  I would scream uncontrollably until the litter shakes itself off of my body :S,Positive

9436,less censorship more fun?, I guess thats the rule of life :) We live once  may as well enjoy it right?,Positive
9437,lily loveless or Kathryn Prescott ?, Hmmmmm  thats difficult. Im attracted to Kat more (there is something that draws me in) but I think I could get on with Lily better. So  hard to say. Can I be greedy and say both? :P,Positive

I think  with Emily  its going too far and they just need to sort it out  even argue it out  but at least get things said and out in the open. They are trying to act as though things are fine  even though both of them know it isn't. I think it is driving them both insane  and perhaps thats why Emily is looking at Mandy  maybe as a way out? I know for sure they are going to sort everything out  but I am disappointed it is going to be so late in the series :(,Positive

9585,Should they make an 'age limit Action Man' for anyone who doesn't want to scare their children into thinking all men have nothing downstairs?, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I think it might be worthwhile  but by doing that  they highlight it to all the innocent Kids  then they will all want one lol. I didn't even notice  at least I was an innocent one ;),Positive
9586,Should your partner also be your best friend?, I think its important yes  BUT it is also important to have a close friend outside the relationship. Just because if anything ever happened and you went through a 'rough patch'  sometimes other people can make you see things clearer. So  I think they can  but to have someone else outside the relationship is even more important.,Positive
9587,Shouldn't the opposite of shut up be shut down?, Hmmm  tricky. Thats the same thing. I suppose all in all  they should shut it yeah? :P,Positive

9592,Snog of Send off - you have to say which out of the two you would snog and which you would send off. When I say send off  it's like in football (soccer for you non-UK people) when they send someone off who has done bad.  Kat and Lily Emily and Naomi ???, Snog Emily and Lily  send off Naomi and Kat (SOrrrrrry Kat! I still love you  but you know  Emily and Lily more <3333) lol,Positive

Im going to be down there by myself  and living without my parents would be AMAZING!  Still scary though :S Mixed minds about it :D,Positive
9595,so  who do you get along with best  mum or dad?, Mum  definitely :) although  I know she doesn't agree with me being Gay  but I still get on with her better than I do my dad. I argue with my father ALL the time  about any little thing! Its just  terrible! We just don't gel all that well...,Positive
9596,So are you looking for love or just some fun?, I believe that is a trick question. Both can happen together ;),Positive
9597,so i have this bad habit of picking my nail polish off when im bored (and sometimes when im nervous)... should i just stop painting my nails? :-(, Nooooo! Don't stop! Because they you have nothing to stop you being bored :( I do it too  but I LOVEEEEEEEE painted nails! I actually LOVEEEEE them :D Mine are always painted  but Im not so into that manicured stuff  I like them to be flashy :) So  don't stop :) If you're bored. Come to me :D,Positive
9598,so if i became a doctor i think id be and obstetrician... well id ACTUALLY be a psychologist  but if if ever became a more doctor-doctor.. i think id be an obstetrician... idk.. sorry i'm so weird...:-), What the hell is an 'obstetrician'? :S YOU AREN'T WEIRD!!! :) You are amazing! No weirdness is in amazing  so I let you go freeeeeee  free from your weirdness. Okay  yeah  I think im weird :/ lol,Positive
9599,so my friend says that the 'whole gay thing' (whatever the hell she means by that) is more recent and hasnt been around for a long time.. i looked at her funny and said 'so why  in ancient Greece and Rome  did all those guys make all those nude statues..., Okay...,Positive
9600,so said i would (or at least i thought i would anyway)... would you? :-), Of course ;),Positive
9601,Some people have their babies names planned out. Do you? What do you want? A boy? 2 girls? 2 boys 2 girls? Any ideas? :) If it was with a girl  some people want to have them themselves  would you want to have the children or your partner?, Stealing my questions now are we? :P Well I haven't thought much about the first few  the how many I want  their names etc. I don't know if I want boys or girls either  probably girls  but it doesn't really matter to me. I know I definitely want to have children  but in the relationship  I can see myself more as the caring person  so I don't know if I would have the children necessarily. I suppose you can have a child each (keep popping them out ;) lol) but  I don't know if I really want to actually have one. Its hard to say really  im not in a position at the moment where I want kids here and now  definitely not  so I guess I can comment more near the time :),Positive
9602,somehow i managed to fall and hurt my ankle.. i was cursing because it fucking hurt.. and you were giggling at my klutsness.. but then you felt bad b/c you saw that i couldnt get up (my ankle was hurt that badly) so you helped me up and we started.., Awww bless you!,Positive
9603,someone should block my computer from watching skins and grey's anatomy in the same day... hence the uncontrollable crying..., :((((((( I would  but then you actually wouldn't get to watch it  and I know you want to watch it. How about I come over and comfort you instead? :),Positive
9604,soon you shall be the only person on my twitter feed, HAHAHAHAHA! Twitter is pretty dead. At least im making an impact :),Positive
9605,sorry i started giving you grey's random questions/issues in the episode... i was a bit crazy at the time.. :-p, Its okay  you needed to geek out about the show  and I wasn't around to actually chat :) soooo  all in all  just formspring me any random spurts you get. That would sort things out nicely :D,Positive
9606,sorry no more me hints... i follow you but you don't follow me (on twitter that is) im from the U.S. (New Jersey to be exact) you dont know me in real life im a huge naomily fan(but thats not much of a hint now is it?) ;-) my (twitter) name starts w/'t', TORI!!!

Okay  so we need somewhere relaxing  and Im not a hugeeeee lover of JUST beaches. But somewhere with a nice beach  a good nightlife (because I can imagine its not the best in Alaska)  and somewhere with a really nice hotel ;) How aboutttttt  Los Angeles? In the summer obviously? Have you ever been there? Or would you want to get out of america?  I went there and I loved it  but I wasn't (and Im still not) 21 so I couldn't go out :( But it looked pretty lively and there again you have the beach to relax upon too :) So  what do you think? Its not TOO hot either  well it wasn't when I went so it sounds like a nice plan :) Lots of sunset walks and going out for dinner? Or staying in and ordering room service ;) lol,Positive
9610,Sounds like a plan  but that would involve my brother&&his girlfriend seeing me  not that I'm that bothered :L, Done and dusted :P You need a Harry Potter cape thing  not that I watch it  but you know.,Positive
9611,soup or salad?, Hmmm  Salad :),Positive
9612,spaghetti or linguine?, Linguine :) Im not a massive fan of spaghetti actually :(,Positive
9613,special in a good way..., Thanks :D <3,Positive
9614,Spit or swallow?, Next question...,Positive
9615,Spontaneity or stability?, It depends on what its for. I like spontaneity in a relationship  I think the unexpected things can keep love alivvvvvvvve. Stability with things I need lol. For example &quot;Kel  you don't need your car today do you?&quot; &quot;yeah  why?&quot; &quot;Oh  your dad just lent it to a friend&quot; &quot;.......&quot; lol,Positive
9616,stars and moon or clouds and sun??, Hmmm  depends on my intentions. If I am going out gardening  then clouds and sun  if im going for a romantic drive with the top down on my car  stars and moon (AS LONG AS ITS STILL WARM) :),Positive

Cooking made everything better! thats cute :),Positive
9620,Still WRONG! Banana's should make you think of Naomi ;D, Ohhh I see. Well yeah  she did eat a lot of them in Season 3. BUT  there have been no Naomi-banana-eating in Season 4  so for me  she is a garibaldi person. Ask me that question about Garibaldis  then you are sure to get Naomi... :P,Positive
9621,stressed?, Occasionally  but not at the moment :),Positive
9622,stripes or dot?... clothing-wise, Hmm  stripes?,Positive

9626,sunset or sunrise?, Sunset  it means its closer to bedtime lol! Sunrise is tooooo early :( Also  sunset  when its warm  romanticccccc :) How about you?,Positive
9627,SUPPORT HER BECAUSE SHE IS TALL! AND LIKE AMAZING AND LIKE BUMMM!!!, HAHA! &quot;Bummm&quot;? You mean fit? LOL! Not my cup of tea darlin' ;) She is pretty though! Oh  and Im will you on the tall thing! GO TAYLOR BECAUSE YOU'RE TALL!! :D,Positive

Well  they may say something along those lines :P I haven't used a camera in a WHILLLE so bare with me. Also  I only have a crappy mini DV camera :S I want to get a HD Camcorder  but don't have the cash atm :(,Positive
9629,tall-dark-and-drop-dead-gorgeous..or..shy-reserved-short-and-cute?, shy-reserved-short and cute :) DEFINITELY! Everyone knows im not into that typical 'hot' kind of stereotype look. Being cute does it for me so much more :),Positive
9630,tan or pale?, Pale  definitely. Its more natural. I don't mean  like scary white  but it completely depends on their natural skin tone. If someone is naturally olive skinned  then darker  but if they are naturally lighter  they don't need to be tanned to be beautiful :),Positive
9631,tattoo or piercing?, Hmm  thats a hard one. It depends on where the tattoo or piercing is. I LOVE tongue lip (centre stud) piercings  and any in your ear  as for tattoos. As long as its nothing too cheap looking  or nothing too big  or on your face or something :S So yeah  piercings :) I CAN NOT STAND eyebrow piercings though. Thats probably the worst for me (besides weird cheek studs or something :S),Positive
9632,Te amo!!!! <333, Love you toooooo :D,Positive
9633,tea or coffee, Tea. With half a bucket of milk :),Positive
9634,Tease!, Indeedio ;) Just like my fanfiction :),Positive
9635,TELL LOUISE TO STOP MAKING OUT LIKE IT'S ME!!!!, You have no idea how confusing all this is :S Post names  please and thanks :),Positive
9636,Tell me about a time when you hurt yourself as a child - whose fault was it? Did you cry? (if you did just admit it  nothing wrong with tears!) What did you hurt? Did you have to go to hospital?, I was once pushed down concrete steps by my sister  and my scull was cracked open. I had to go to hospital to get it stapled back together :S Im sure I cried at the time  I can't remember it  but I have been told :/ There was blood everywhere too  so its not too lame to cry :P,Positive
9637,tell me something no one else knows about you?, If I tell you over this  then everyone will know :(,Positive
9638,tell me your life story?, Oh god! Okay  ready for an essay from me this time? :P  So  I was born. Which I don't remember  otherwise that would have been a sight! I open my eyes  to see and hear &quot;pushhhhhhhhh&quot; and a little slit with light coming through-ahem! I shall start a little later :P  I went to primary school  and all through the 6 years  I was such a good girl  and I was even encouraged by a teacher to do something wrong because I saw so innocent.  I got bullied pretty badly through the years 4-6 and eventually I started to stick up for myself towards the end  so they dropped it and left me alone. I won :D Anyway  In year 6 I had my first (and little did I know  last) crush on a boy. I told my mum  and she got really excited that i was 'growing up'. Well  this crush was really big (or at least I thought it was at the time) and I Remember at our end of year prom thing  he asked me out. I got really embarrassed and I ended up saying no (which I kicked myself for in the end). I started secondary school  and my parents wanted me to go to the school that my sister goes to. It is SUCH a good school  but I refused because all my friends were going to my local one  and I wanted to go with them. Well I started school fine  and got along really well with everyone. About a year later  the people who I went to school with  aka my friends from primary school  started to pick on me. It got really bad again  and I ended up having no one.  I met another friend  Laura and she helped me through everything. Eventually we became best friends  and the other group of friends now started to pick on her because she was friends with me. One day  I thought enough is enough  and I went to a teacher about the bullying. She phoned up both of our parents  and let them know what was happening. About a week later  once things had started to calm down a little  the girl who bullied me  her mum phoned up the school  saying that I was now bullying her! I was called into a meeting with the bully herself and another teacher to sort this out. This teacher was crap  and basically believed everything the other girl was saying  just because she was coming off &quot;sweet and innocent&quot;. My mum heard about this  and called up the bullys mum to have a chat with her. She came around our house  and was trying to pick a fight with my mum outside  all while I was listening to them argue while hiding under the stairs. She left  and my mum refused to engage in a fight over something that could be sorted without parental violence. Nothing was ever sorted  and I think the girl (the bully) got a little scared about being found out and her mums temper  that she finally left me alone. So  I was happy again :)  I finished secondary school pretty happy. I was top of most of my classes  and i even was entered into this british art competition by my art teacher  which I won :D I loved art at school  and every lunch and after school  my art teacher let us have her room so I could sit and carry on with my work. Because I loved it so much! she wouldn't let anyone else in their  except for me and my friends  because I was her no1 student :) Well  life was good until I started to become confused about my sexuality. I didn't think much about it at first  only that all my friends were talking about 'boys' and I couldn't agree or relate to anything that they were saying.  Well  I finished school really confused  and went onto college to study further subjects. I grew apart from my old friends  because being in a different college  with a different time table  its awkward to keep in touch so well as you were before. So I made a new circle of friends  and I got really close to one girl in particular. We became best friends  and told eachother everything. About 2 years after being friends  I decided I wanted to tell someone about me being gay  and thought she was the best person to tell. So  I told her  and almost instantly  she abandoned me :( We didn't really speak anymore  and I know it was because I freaked her out  and she didnt want to have a 'lesbian' as her best friend :(  So  I moved on and decided I didn't want to have a friend like her if something as small as sexuality would ruin our relationship. So anyway  I started my art foundation year  and I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! It was one of the best times of my life  and Idid love the end parts in particular. I went through that phase  of not being bothered to go  and I did take a bit of time off (usually to sleep on at home lol)  but I still came out with one of the best grades out of a couple of hundred people. So I was really proud :D  Anyway  once finishing that year  I didn't know what I wanted to continue on to university  so I decided to take a gap year  and build up a little money and sort my head out with what I actually wanted to do. in the year I was working for my parents a bit  property developing and stuff. The year turned into 2  and I kind of went astray from any dreams that I really wanted. Which is why I did something about it  got my ass in gear and applied to Brighton Film School. Well  I got in  as you know  and that pretty much leads me up to now :)  Soooo  I AM SO SORRY about this essay :P I hope you haven't fallen asleep  and I sincerely appologise if you have :( So  in response to yours  you don't have to apologise about it being long! and it wasn't boring  its interesting to hear everything that has gone on with your life. I would consider you as a friend too  so that means I want to know about everything :D,Positive
9639,Tell us all something ourageous you've done that would surprise us?, Ermmmm  waking up next to a bloke after taking E and thinking &quot;SHIIIIIIT!&quot;. *whistles and walks out quietly* :S,Positive
9640,temple massage or back massage?, Oooo  this is difficult  I would say back massage :) A good back massage can let everything melt away :))))) I haven't had one in years though :(,Positive

9651,the descent is pretty good  havent seen the second one as of yet  Tbh i thought it would be a let down to the first., Yeah  its not a let down so much  but it doesnt seem to go anywhere. It doesnt grow. It kind of feels like they chopped the 1st one in half  added more video and stuck it back together again. There was no growth or development :(,Positive
9652,the i miss you wasnt me.. even though i do miss you :-) haha, I was actually going to go to bed  but now you are home  Im not :P I missed you too :( Hmmm  I need to find out who this was from then....hmmmm.....,Positive
9653,The last song you listened to?, Is it embarrassing if I said 'Tik Tok' by Ke$ha. O_O,Positive
9654,The oldest virgin is rumored to be Sir Isaac Newton who died a virgin at the age of 85. :-O, OMG! Was he a virgin?! Poooooooooor guy!!! I mean  at 84  he really didn't have much of a chance did he? It probably wouldn't work at that age. Blessssss him! That sucks :(,Positive
9655,the same as always  dont know if the person feels the same way., Well  personally  I kind of thing you need to know if the person at least things of you that way a little. Have you tried reading little signs and stuff that they give you? Got anything from that?,Positive
9656,The Stupids is about a family Mr and Mrs Stupid and their children. They're rather quite stupid. It's a comedy and is rather hilarious...they're just stupid! Haha. It's awesome. They do something good  it's a nice story. Only available on region 1 DVD :-(, Ohhhh  well thats a faillll because I don't have a multiregional player :( I might watch it online or something  Thanks :D,Positive
9657,the weather is weirdddddddd..., At least its always surprising us :),Positive
9658,THERE WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT LYRICS IN THAT EMO LYRICS THING !SO THERE!, hahahaha! Did you just google it to test me? You tested me! Coooooool :P,Positive
9659,these are not the questions i had planned... i love my notebook :-O haha oops :-P, haha! Well they are pretty good to me :D You always ask really good questions  this is obviously why. You plan and are potentially really organised :P,Positive
9660,They dont have a scooby about it. I cant speak to them about it  and no. x, Hmmmmmm. Are you ready for a relationship with someone else? Because I know dating someone doesn't sound like the best way to get over someone else  but sometimes it really can help :) x,Positive
9661,they were pretty nice ;-)... im not going to go into detail  otherwise it'll just end up like another fluffy/smutty fanfic.. <3 haha i wouldnt want to bore you with all the juicy details of my interesting dream life.. :-p, Hahaha! I just noticed that you copied this in one of my questions! HA! Thats hilarious! :P I shall use my imagination then  just like the doctor ordered ;) There was fluff and smut?

9662,Think about it K-dawg. Jewish cure. What does it sound like to you?, Isn't Jewish Cure a band or something??,Positive
9663,Think of the last person who you really knew that died. You have the chance to give them 1 hour of life back  but you have to give one year of your life. Do you?, This is a difficult question. Even if there wasn't a year of my life in the balance  I don't know if I would. When you lose the people that you love  its so so painful  and to get them back  even for a moment  you know you are going to go through all that pain again. Is it worth it? So no  I probably wouldn't :(,Positive
9664,Think of the last time you were REALLY angry, Work today! :( A group of 5 guests walked out without paying their bill  and I wasn't around at that precise moment to stop them  so they left  getting off scott free. I spoke to my manager  and he said that  &quot;they are my responsibility so I need to pay the bill with my own money&quot;. The bill was u00a380  and they were having a laugh if they thought I was paying that with my own cash! I can't keep an eye on my tables 100% of the time  because 99% of the time  I am doing things for them  which do involve walking to other areas of the restaurant. So anyway  this sparked a huge argument between me and my manager  and I wasn't backing down  and giving in resulting in myself being out of pocket. It was out of my control  and the company generates so much money  so why should they use their staff to continue generating profits? Well  I was SO SO SO angry  and I eventually went to the staff toilets to have a little cry due to the frustration of the situation.  It was sorted in the end  and because I didn't back down and agree to give it to them  they let it go lol. Like they should have too!,Positive
9665,Thinking about colors of the rainbow  what color are you? Your friends? Your enemies?, Ummm  I would say perhaps green?  Because im quite a cheerful person  but sometimes I can be pushed  and I may become down about something becoming 'blue' ;)  OR  on the other hand  im easily cheered up about something  becoming a happy yellow! I have no idea lol  im just thinking logically :P,Positive
9666,This is my rifle  There are many like it but this one is mine  Without my rifle I am nothing  Without me my rife is nothing!!, Isn't that from a Family Guy episode?,Positive
9667,thong or push-up bra? or neither? or both? haha, HAHA! Push up bra! lol! Im not a fan of thongs :/ Obviously for some occasions  but not overly keen :P,Positive
9668,to be  or not to be??, To be...definitely. Sounds better :),Positive
9669,toast with butter  or jam?, Okay  here is my toast routine  and it has to be precise :) When the toast pops up  it has to be buttered STRAIGHT away  so that the butter melts and then you eat while still warm :) So the answer (after the essay about toast)  butter :),Positive
9670,tom-boys or girly-girls?, GIRLY-GIRLS! Definitely :D I don't really understand lesbians that fancy girls that look like boys. I have no problem with it  obviously  I just personally don't get it. I like girls  so I like girls that look like girls lol. :),Positive
9671,Toys or fingers? I seem to remember that fingers worked well, Hmmm  some people already know the answer to that. You know who you are ;),Positive
9672,twig in the eye  ill remember that one., It would totally shut him up :),Positive

9683,want to go for a walk?, yes please :) I want to get some fresh air  but its dark and scary outside  so not by myself :(,Positive
9684,Watching a film/movie  what are the 3 things you must have before you can sit down to watch?, Hmmm  okay drink  remote control and a jumper (if its cold :)),Positive
9685,watching the olympics... in my opinion  curling is more interesting to watch than speed skiing, Well at least they are keeping the floors nice and clean... Am I the only one that secretly REALLY wants them to hit the stone thing by accident  and send it back the other way? That would be some good ass entertainment :D,Positive
9686,way to hate my birthday month kelly.. :-(, Sorrrry :( It's not because of you though missy :P That actually makes it better :) You are welcome to hate mine? :),Positive

Trust me on that :P I think I should come to your classes and have a word with your teacher? He seems rather morbid  I think I can achieve a better and more positive atmosphere in the classroom ;),Positive
9689,weirdest person you've ever met?, Because of the job that I do  I am constantly meeting and engaging with new people. Some of them are nice  some of them...not. Some weird  some eccentric  some rude  some polite. Its hard to put a definition on 'weirdest' and to pin a certain person down. Definitely some of the customers I meet are very weird (if I take it as the 'odd' interpretation)  for example  once I had 2 guys sat down in one of my tables  and one kept staring at me. It was a little offputting  so I tried to avoid them as much as I could. When I was putting their food down  a member of staff (a guy) said bye to me  gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The guy on my table  stood up  eyed him with the worst look as my friend walked out. He then looked at me and said &quot;he doesn't appreciate your eyes. He looks about 12  pshhhhh&quot;  then sat down and ate. LOL!!! Thats just one weirdo  I meet a lot :P,Positive
9690,well  i love you <33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333<<< THIS MUCH!!! ;-), Hmmmmm  well  thats quiet a lot :) I agree  thats love ;) <33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 x infinity ;),Positive
9691,well i was watchin an interview on afterellen 2day and kat sort of gav away they have a happy ending so i hope its tru but i kind of like seein naomi b jealous i saw the previews 4 nxt week, YEAH! That part on After Ellen was hilarious! Kat was like &quot;well their is a hap-!&quot; and lily makes a strange &quot;Bzz&quot; ing noise or something! That was too cute for words! lol! So yeah  its probably about showing Naomi how much she really cares (again). But hey  I love jealous Naomi! Only because I think Emily needs to see it. So yeah  sounds good for the ending XD I hope they don't do anything like they did last series though (Gen1 I mean) no one really had happy endings :S It was sad :''''''(,Positive
9692,well i'd hope you'd marry me... seeing as we are already planning our honeymoon and all ;-) haha, Haha! Well technically we are already married  so seeing as you are my newly wed  I had to choose you ;) How about you? Snog  Marry  Avoid? :),Positive
9693,well if you are then you are a very cute idiot... and i love your rambling...<3, Awwww &quot;A very cute idiot&quot; I have never awwed at being called an idiot before :P <3,Positive
9694,were you a very naughty girl at school ;), Actually  for your information. I was probably the most innocent and well behaved :P,Positive
9695,Were you named after someone?, No  I was just named Kelly because my dad liked it. They put a lot of thought into that one didn't then :P But imagine if I was named my mums old surname (which would have been changed to blake once she got married) and then they split up  going back to her former surname. What a shit name! lol,Positive
9696,what 'religion' are you? are you at all religious? are you spiritual?, I don't really believe in anything in particular. Im more a mix of views and stuff rather than sticking to any religion exactly.  I was baptised  so technically I am a christian  but im not in the sense that I don't believe in God. Well  I don't not believe  but I don't believe exactly either lol. Im an Athiest I suppose :) How about you? :),Positive
9697,what about poverty?, Poverty frankly sucks. Don't get me started on this :S Why are places like Africa still in so much debt  when all they do is borrow money from other countries = to pay back other debts  therefore getting themselves worse in the process. Where is good will these days? Why cant 3rd world debt be abolished? As for poverty in other situations. Some people who are lazy and can't be bothered to give a shit  I don't feel for. But the people who are trying to get by  but cant because of tax and loans and owing people shit  what's the point? We are all people  cant we live the same? too many issues for a single post :),Positive
9698,what am i listening to right now?, Errrrrm  im going to be obvious and say Ellie? lol,Positive
9699,what amazes you?, Hmmmm  spontaneity? :D When something is unexpected  or is truly fantastic  that amazes me :) Also if someone did something for me  even if its something small  I just melt :D,Positive
9700,What American TV shows do you/did you watch?, Buffy  Angel  Charmed  The OC  South of Nowhere  Friends. Mostly the high school ones  probably because I can relate to them better :),Positive
9701,What animal do you look like/resemble?, HAHA! Animal? Ummm  I don't think I really resemble any animals lol. Well the closest would probably be an ape  but thats only because of evolutional purposes  Im not big and hairy! :P lol,Positive
9702,What are some of the craziest things you've ever done?, Ummm  I have never been that crazy really. Well  I can't remember  and that may be a good thing lol! I wasn't a boring teenager  but I was never  lets say like Cook (and I know you watch Skins ;) lol). Im not the person to say &quot;don't do this  don't do that&quot;  I do like to try things  but I suppose I have never been &quot;CRAZY-esque&quot; :),Positive
9703,What are the three 'nevers' of your life?, Never Cheat. Never lose hope. Never give in.,Positive
9704,What are we having for dinner tonight ?, I had spaghetti bolognaise with a meat substitute. How yummy :),Positive
9705,What are you most excited about right now?, Right now  a night in without the parents. How exciting (that was sarcasm by the way) :),Positive
9706,What are your 3 favorite drinks?, Hmmm  can I name cocktails? Rasbaretto (Rasberry liqueur  ameretto and vanilla ice cream) Barnamint Baileys (Baileys  mint liqueur  oreo cookies  vanilla ice-cream) June Bug (Midori  Malibu  sweet and sour  pineapple juice),Positive
9707,what are your addictions? ...like im addicted to tv.. and other things.. :-P, Im addicted to music  without doubt! and probably twitter and formspring (which is really bad! Your fault :P haha),Positive
9708,What are your parents like?, Well  my mum is kind of an easy going person BUT she can be REALLY annoying! She always jumps to things  for example &quot;Kelly  feed the animals&quot; &quot;Okay  give me 10 minutes then I will do it&quot; &quot;Okay  but you better  they will die with no food. Rabbits need to be fed every day otherwise they need to go to the vets&quot; &quot;yes  okay mum&quot; &quot;I mean it Kelly. Tonight&quot; &quot;yeah mum! I know&quot; &quot;they will die otherwise&quot; *I ignore* lol  My dad  well he is the opposite really. Things he wants  he gets. He want's something done a certain way  thats how its done. He is pretty argumentative too  which is probably why we clash. I stick up for things that I believe in  so we don't get on like the best of people :( How about yours? :),Positive
9709,what are your terms of endearment?? :-), Well I say sweetie  hun  lovely quite a bit. I don't really say babe  not even in the romantic kind of way  its not the nicest of things to be called lol. If I find someone attractive then I call them gorgeous  or beautiful or something :) If I were dating someone  I would probably call them gorgeous a lot lol. I call Bella gorgeous all the time! Because she is just tooooo beautiful for words :D,Positive
9710,What are your thoughts on the weather right now?, ITS COLDDDDDDD :'(,Positive
9711,What are your ultimate goals for the next 5 years? How about 10 years? What can you see yourself doing?, Well  in 5 years  I would like to see myself having successfully completed the motion picture film course in Brighton  and hopefully I would have made some useful contacts within the filming industry. I would hopefully be starting out in smaller projects (perhaps even as a runner) and by 5 years  would like to see myself having created some successful short films to take to international short film festivals. In 10 years  I would like to see myself having started out in direction or production of small independent films  and starting to settle down with a family :),Positive
9712,What are your views on love at first sight? Possible? Impossible?, Ummm  I don't know if its possible  but I believe that someone could have STRONG feelings for someone at first sight. For me  falling in love means falling in love with their personality too  and you can't know their personality by just looking at them. So for me  not possible :P,Positive
9713,WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY IN BRIZZLE RIGHT NOW?, Pink.,Positive
9714,What color would a smurf turn if you choked it?, Well we turn blue  and humans are a yellowish colour. So  I guess they would turn our colour?,Positive
9715,What conditioner do you use?, Same  Caude Michel &quot;Colour Protect&quot;. Smells lovely!,Positive
9716,what did you think of katie's episode?, A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! :D I think the premature menopause thing was a bit random  I would have liked it to have been something else (she just seems too young for that) but on a good note. I loved the Naomily angst  and Im glad Emily is going all &quot;off the rails&quot; let Naomi know exactly what she has done to her :S Plussss  the Fitches. A whole 45 minute episode around the Fitches. Can't complain at that XD What did you think?,Positive
9717,what did you use to dye your hair red?, Live XXL Hair colour in &quot;Red Passion&quot; :) Although  I used a garnier nutrisse browny colour as a base.,Positive
9718,What different colors have your hair been?, Ummmm  blonde  brown  red  purple and pink :) Soon going back to blonde (bleach) but still a natural-ish colour :),Positive
9719,what do you call a cob down in Brizzle?, A cob? As in sweetcorn? LOL!,Positive
9720,What do you call male ballerinas?, Mallerinas?,Positive
9721,What do you do  when you fall for someone who would never feel the same?, It depends  you have to ask yourself; is there a chance we could ever be something? If the answer is yes  then thats a good start. You need to get to know that person and then go from there.  If the answer is &quot;not a chance!&quot; then  its really shit  but you need to stop yourself from falling any harder than you already have. I know its hard to do  and its much easier for someone else to say &quot;get over them&quot; because its a fucking hard thing to do! To get over someone  especially when you have fallen hard  it really hurts  but you need to catch it before it ends up getting worse. You know? If you know there definitely isn't a chance between you  and you know that you are ready for a relationship  its probably best to find someone else and concentrate your feelings on them instead. If you are willing to let your feelings (for the other person go)  involving yourself with someone can let them melt away. Anyway  its never easy  and to persue them can be an easier way out  but it all depends on how strong you are  and the person you have fallen for. Okay  essay answer. Good luck :),Positive
9722,what do you do if you know someone is hiding something from you?, It depends on what it is  if its something that involves or affects you  then you call them out on it. If its something that is personal to them  then let them come to you in their own time. Either way  give them time to come to you about it  and then resort to the above option after you've given them a chance to explain. I don't know if that really helps?,Positive
9723,What do you do if you love somebody but you know that they don't like you in the same way?, Well it pretty much sucks to be honest. Its happened to me before  and its really hard to deal with. I think rather than giving up  make sure there is no chance with them. If there is  then go for it! You have nothing to lose. If there isn't a chance I think then you need to try and think about all the negative things about that person  to try and snap yourself out of it  at least until some of the pains wears off :(,Positive
9724,what do you do when you get nervous/anxious?, Whenever something important is out of my control. Like  if something has happened in work  and im going to be in trouble for example ;) Or an interview  because you have no control over the situation (apart from how you come across) it can be bloody scary! :(,Positive
9725,What do you eat/drink when you go to the cinema?, I normally drink water  and eat....I guess revels? If I eat anything  its maltesers or Revels :),Positive
9726,What do you label youself as?, Individual? :),Positive
9727,what do you like better  asking or answering?, Probably both  depending on my mood :),Positive
9728,What do you like most about girls?, Well  obviously im gay  so I can't comment about things on guys  but girls. I love how feminine they can be (not in a Paris or Nicole way  GOD NO) but how a girl can be all &quot;does my bum look big in this?&quot; or &quot;what colour dress?&quot;  its just rather cute  lol. Also  girls are pretty hot. What can I say ;) and AGAIN  the sensitivity thing. A girl can get you more than a guy can  so I think to understand your partner in a relationship  is pretty damn important :),Positive
9729,What do you look for in a date?, I look for someone who is similar to me actually. I would say that someone trusting  honest  caring  funny  cute  romantic are all qualities that I look for in someone who I would potentially date :),Positive
9730,What do you love most about your family? and why?, Their ability to constantly be at eachothers throats. Wow. Don't you just love it :P,Positive
9731,what do you prefer someone else doing  playing with your hair or stroking your skin?, Hmmmm  probably stroking my Skin <333 Both are so relaxing though :),Positive
9732,What do you really think of the people from Leicester, The majority of them are probably cool beans  however  there is an odd few that  well  what can I say. Let the standards of the UK slip ;),Positive
9733,what do you think about poverty?, Seeing as this question was about Puberty and not poverty  there really isn't very many issues I feel about it. Except that fact  that its obviously good  otherwise there would be young men wandering around with incredibly hight pitched voices. That would be confusing.,Positive
9734,What do you think most people talk about when dating?, If the date is going really well  then I think people should be honest with everything. If you mean the first date  then obviously stay away from any exes lol. Thats a typical no no :P,Positive
9735,What do you think of Canada  and it's canadians? ;), Canadians are Turds! Its the American's that float my boat ;),Positive
9736,What do you think of Canada  and it's canadians? ;), They're turds. Its the Americans that I love ;),Positive
9737,what do you think of poetry?, I think it can be a really expressive way of saying your feelings :) Some poems REALLY confuse me like ANYTHING though. Mainly the ones that we had to study in English. But if its written to someone  meaning to be a way to project how they feel about them  then it is DEAD sweet :D,Positive
9738,what does it mean to ship someone????, to ship? It means to believe in a couple  believe that they work. Kind of :),Positive
9739,What does it mean to you to allow another person to fully love you?, It means I let them in? I embrace their feelings and eventually can return them? I don't have problems letting people in  but I do know a lot of people who like to shut people out. ...and yes  It drives me crazy :(,Positive
9740,what does JC mean?, No clue :/,Positive
9741,What does Jewish Cure Mean?, Some religious correction for something? :S,Positive
9742,what does your conditioner smell like???, Ummm  like a strawberry kind of cherry scent :),Positive
9743,what excites you?, You  but im sure you know that already. Anything where I can see someone has gone out of their way to either talk to me  do something for me. But all in all  when someone has done something really really special  that took so much effort  and it was all for me  I really really melt <3,Positive
9744,What experience has changed your outlook on life?, I have no idea :/ and Im too exhausted right now to even think about it :S Ummm  you mean my experience or others? Maybe something like  being serious and never letting loose may get you a good job  but it's not a way to enjoy life.,Positive
9745,What family member do you wish you knew better? why?, Probably my cousin  because she is the person who I get on with the best outside of the people that I live with.,Positive
9746,What favorite food puts you in a great mood?, CHOCOLATE!!! Anything with Chocolate in  and I just dieeeeee! Milk or white though  no dark stuff :S,Positive
9747,What five things will you always find on you?, Phone  Car keys  house keys  money  jewellery and clothing ;),Positive
9748,What happends when you take heroin?, Dunno. You get high?,Positive
9749,What happened in your most recent dream?, Ummmmmm  I think it was the Kat/Meg one. The one where I was pestering Meg for an autograph  and Kat burst out crying.  Kat was trying to explain  but Meg pulled her away. All she said was &quot;boyfriend..&quot; lol. Then they went into a premiere of something  and I was left stood there  by my lonesome of the shopping mall...then I lost my car in the car park. It was all very random :/,Positive
9750,WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU CROSS A DUCK ??, hmmm  you end up chasing after it? :/,Positive
9751,What happens in the shed  stays in the shed. Do you agree?, Of course. Its your little area of &quot;special talk&quot;,Positive
9752,What have you done?, I would like to ask myself the same question... :/,Positive
9753,what if i told you i was a spy? ;-), Well it certainly would make sense as to why all the questions ;) haha So missy  what are you spying on me for? :P,Positive
9754,What impact are you wanting to leave on the world?, I don't know if I would ever leave one  but being remembered for doing something great  that would be awesome :D It doesn't even have to be big  just something that people would respect you for in years to come :),Positive
9755,What in life  is beautiful to you? Where do you find inspiration?, I think life is beautiful. In general. Everything about it  where we came from  how we were created  if it was indeed a miracle or a scientific explosion. I think there is inspiration to find in everything. Its not limited to a certain flower or building  its in everything around us  people  surroundings  flowers. Its just about how you see it :),Positive
9756,What is more difficult for you; looking into someoneu2019s eyes when you are telling someone how you feel  or looking into someoneu2019s eyes when they are telling you how they feel?, What's harder? DEFINITELY telling someone else. Only because  if someone is telling you how they feel  at least you have the control of the situation  and you can control how you react. However  if you are telling someone you love them  you have completely put yourself out there  and have no input on where the conversation goes next. Its all about having the control of the situation  and even if you don't feel the same  at least you aren't putting your heart on the line :),Positive
9757,What is on your bedside table? Do you have a bedside table?, I do have a bedside table indeed. Its a black wooden effect thing  and I have a small lamp  my remote controls  a bottle of perfume  my phone (when I sleep) and a coaster (for a drink) :),Positive
9758,What is the 'dirtiest' thing that you have ever done? ;-), HAHA! I don't think I can post that on here ;);),Positive

9761,What is the currency in your country?, POUNDS!!! GBP BABY!  lol,Positive
9762,What is the difference between existence and essence?, No idea  and thats too many 'e's and 's's to even bare thinking about :) Diddums...,Positive
9763,What is the farthest you have been from home?, Probably LA. It was a 14 hour flight from home  and I hate flying so it was HORRRRRRRRRIBLE :'(,Positive
9764,What is the first thing you notice about people?, Probably their eyes. Thats what you look at when you talk to someone  and you can tell a lot about a person from looking into their eyes. Not what is going on with them and their life history  of course not  but you can get a vibe of 'what that person is like' if that makes sense? sometimes you are wrong  but hey  its the best judge of character when looking at someone :),Positive
9765,What is the happiest situation you could imagine yourself being in? :-), I can imagine? Well happily married  perfect job  perfect kids  perfect life :D Whatever 'perfect' is :D (and no im not Katie :P),Positive
9766,What is the scariest situation that you could imagine yourself being in? :-O, Losing all the people who I love  any form of communication with the world. Being paralyzed and unable to speak  all of the above :'(,Positive
9767,What is the silliest prank you ever played on someone?, Well  I remember once  when we had not long been back from seeing &quot;The Grudge&quot; in the cinema  and I had an idea to freak my mum out. So  the next day  I got down this polystyrene head thing that I had  drew eyes on it with eyeliner  and pulled out this fake black wig I had from a fancy dress thing and dressed the wig with it. I then pulled out a floaty white dress thing that I had in my wardrobe  and kind of draped it over the head  making it look like a person. I then hung the head up  in a really odd angle in my parents cupboard under the stairs. When my mum came home  I called her and asked her to get me a bottle of drink from the cupboard  and she said yes. Me and my dad were waiting for the scream  and she returned with the bottle of drink  having not made a sound. Me and my dad were stunned  and asked her if she had seen &quot;it&quot;. &quot;Seen what?&quot; she replied....total and utter fail....lol,Positive
9768,What is the stupidest thing you've done because someone dared you to? :-D, Well  it may not be that stupid  but I will always remember it. All through school  I was always the good girl who never got into trouble. I remember during secondary school  in year 8 (which is about age 11/12) I was on a lunch break and I and all my friends bought a plate of chips for dinner. We were sat eating them in the cafeteria  and people started throwing their chips at us  so my friends started throwing them back  but I refused to join in because I didn't want to get into trouble. Anyway  after much persuasion from my friends  I decided to throw ONE chip to get them off my back. I did  and guess what happened? The teacher saw me  NO ONE else  just me  and I got sent to detention for a week. I was so pissed! lol! Everyone found it funny bar me. Not good...lol,Positive
9769,What is the stupidest thing you've done on your own free will?, Ummmm  Im not really a difficult or 'out there' kind of person  but lets think  there must be something... ........... ........... .......... Nope  can't think of anything. I guess im just not that stupid ;),Positive
9770,What is the weirdest thing you will ever admit to having done in the past?, Well  once I took MDMA once and  well  umm  I was out of it I suppose  and I went to bed with a random bloke! LOL! Im pretty sure nothing happened but still  for me  that is rather crazy :S Probably why I have never done it since lol.,Positive

9795,What is your least favorite word?, I HATEEEE it when people say 'Fanny' or 'fart' (something to do with the f's lol). But I reallllly cannot stand them :S EUGH! haha,Positive

9798,What is your religion or do you not really have one?, I have been baptized so technically I am a christian  but I don't really have any beliefs. I am open minded I guess you could say about things. The one thing I hate about religion  is that is causes too many war.

9800,what is your style?, My style? You mean with hair  make-up  clothing etc? Shall I answer all? lol So hair style  i'm not one of those people who like their hair to look perfect all the time. On occasion  yeah I like to style it but im not anal about it being perfect. I absolutely LOVE messy hair  so I use the natural wave thats in my hair  to create a messy and  kind of bed-head look. I use more hairspray than I probably should  but I like the end effect :) My make-up style  I prefer a natural make-up look for daytime  for example a little eyeliner and gold tone eye shadows. For evening or clubs (depending on my clothing) I LOVE a black smokey eye look (only when its done properly) so I might do something with dark eyeshadows and black makeup  but keep a natural base and nude lips. My clothing...well...do you have a year? lol I don't really go by what things say in magazines or in the fashion world at all. I like to wear what I want  and I don't give a shit if anyone else doesn't like it. I suppose in Skins sense (to refer it to someone) I wear a lot of Effy kind of inspired clothes (slashes  white/black  chains etc) but I like to mix it with different prints and/or colours. Imagine a mix of Effy  Naomi and Emily  and you have my kind of style lol. I once wore my satin dressing gown out as a jacket LOL! It was to a Skins House Party actually  and its blue and a floral pattern  you may have seen it :) So all in all  fuck other people  look how you want to look :),Positive
9801,What is your zodiac sign?, Leo the lion....RAWRRRRRRR...,Positive
9802,What job(s) have you had??, Well my first job (when I was 13) was a paper round. I had to deliver something like 300 newspapers a week  and they were weekly so it all had to be done on one night :S I didn't love that! Then when I was 15  I quit and got myself a job at the local charity shop. It only paid u00a33.50 an hour  but I was only 15 :) Then at 16  I went to a retail clothing shop for a year  it got crap  so I moved to another one (H&amp;M  you might have heard of it) then a year later  I went to TGI fridays  and I have been there for 2 years :) Part time though  while I was at college and stuff :),Positive
9803,what kind of films do you want to...direct?, Well I would LOVE to direct Horror films ideally. Just because they aren't so much about the writing  but more about the direction of the film. You need to think about so many more things  eg cinematography (lighting)  angles  editing. Everything is so much more creative than your standard Rom Com. Its more interesting and much more of a challenge to do it successfully :),Positive
9804,what kind of ice cream did you get? what kind is your favourite?... mine is mint chocolate chip... and it has to be the green kind (not the white)  otherwise its just not right :-), I ended up with Vanilla  but I did do something with it  not just eat vanilla :) My favourite has got to be the mixed exotic kinds. Aka strawberry with pieces  or cookies and cream  and mint choc chip. Good choice by the way ;) IT depends what mood im in :) Love a bit of strawberry though! <333333,Positive

When I listen to songs  I don't really tend to listen to the words too much :P Its more the melody  sooooo  how about I just describe how I feel in the morning  and you can work out a song  yeah? :D Sooo  when I wake up. Usually I don't get enough sleep  so lets just say im not the best morning person there is lol. I like my sleep  and I do sort of  want to never get out of bed :P So  once im actually out of bed  I go into the kitchen and make a drink  pretty pronto.

Hmm  I liked parts of it  and other parts I didn't. I don't think it was written that well  well of course it was if it was just a novel about random people  but for the storyline of Skins  I think it was pretty out of character :( I like reading  but I get distracted pretty easily  so if Im enjoying it  I would continue to read  whereas if its hard to 'get into' then I probably wouldn't even finish it lol.,Positive

We suddenly had this MAD rush of people through the door  and it got really busy. Thing is  I was the only member of staff on  and my manager wasn't turning anyone away  so I was running the whole restaurant by myself. I think I was about to faint in my dream  because of the stress of everyone yelling at me for something to do  that I woke up lol. Then I fell back to sleep rather quickly and went back into it :'( Anywayyy...that doesn't count I take it :P  Well I argue with my family a lot  and I don't really get on with my father. So  we are ALWAYS arguing over things  and it really gets me down. We had a massive argument on tuesday night about something (he treats my sister differently  better  even though she is the one that causes all the trouble).

9900,Which genre of movies do you like most and why?, I LOVEEEEEEE Horror films!!!! I love the feeling of tension and suspense of them  and watching a story unfold is just amazing <3333 Also  to watch it with your partner  its an excuse to cuddle up  right? ;),Positive
9901,Which is a stronger emotion: anger or love?, I think Love is  because if you are angry at someone  you can surpass that  because you still love them. So all in all  I think love tops all :),Positive
9902,which is better  being bullied or being ignored? :-(, Probably being ignored  because you can change that. Being bullied is horrible  and its all out of your control. Talk about messing with your head too! I think bullying is worse :(,Positive

9905,Which is your favourite movie of all time? and your favourite scene in it?, Hmmm  If you asked me this question a year ago  then I would have said &quot;The Descent&quot;  hands down! It was a horror film  but it had so many aspects of those traditional horror films  it wasn't just relying on blood and gore to bring the viewers in (obviously it had that too)  but it was more than the recent horror that is being made...So anyway  I loved it until the second one came out  and it just didn't flow as well as the first  and it didn't make the plot go anywhere. If anything  it went slightly backwards  only because it cleared up things from the first one  that would have been nice left to the imagination... :(,Positive
9906,Which is your most recent favorite song?, Probably 'The Writer' by a certain Miss Goulding :D It's just beautiful!!! Have you heard it?,Positive
9907,which question made you awww? :-) i feel all special that i made you aww <3333, The one where you said about visiting England  how you want to come to Brighton or Bristol  depending on the time because there is someone you wanted to meet.

9910,Which was the last movie you watched and liked? didnt like?, St Trinians :P I wanted to watch it for AGES  and I finally watched it the other day with my parents  and its not that great is it? I thought it was too stupid :S Like  I know it was a comedy but I didn't think it was a stupid slapstick film lol!,Positive
9911,Which was your favorite story as a child?, Well  don't laugh  but I can't even remember the name of it! It was a story of a dragon  who had no friends because he kept doing things wrong and pissing them off. I LOVED it  and I remember when I got too old for it  I still kept it by my bed as a security blanket thing. Gahhh  what was it called?! He was like  an orangey tall dragon thing  and he was really sweet :),Positive
9912,Which way does a compass point in space?, Which every way you want it to my darling. You can talk to them in space  did you know that? They listen and point wherever you wanted. They are like children  only nice :P,Positive
9913,Which would you choose  true love with a guarantee of a heart break or have never loved before? :'-(, True love with a guarantee of heart break. Its better to have loved and lost  than to never have loved at all right? Even though  losing them in the end  is really fucking painful  but the moments shared with them  for me  really out do it :),Positive
9914,which would you prefer... too much light  or too little light?, Too little light :) Its not so harsh :) Also  when things are a little darker  then you can be a little more anticipated :) Plus its a lot more romantic :),Positive
9915,Who am i to tell you  that i would never let you down?, You wouldn't let me down  perhaps not. But who's to say that you wouldn't lie me down...?,Positive
9916,Who am I?, So you arent from lester? REallllllllllly? Are you sure about that? o_O,Positive

9919,Who came first Kathryn or Kathryn? (and no that's not a trick question...hopefully you'll understand!), Kathryn? :/,Positive
9920,who do you aspire to be like?, I actually dont really aspire to be anyone. I think everyone is different  and you can want to do something that someone else has done  but if you aspire to actually be them  you are always going to be disappointed :),Positive
9921,who do you ship in real life?, Who do I ship? If I told people  that would be like letting people on board for free. Need to pay for your tickets :P,Positive
9922,Who does the Olympics have 5 rings?, Who? You mean why? No clue :S,Positive
9923,Who ever is asking it is me that puts the little noses between : and ) ect. Who is asking anyway? :-D, I don't think I can answer that :/,Positive
9924,Who is it?, Now that would be telling ;) haha,Positive
9925,Who is your celebrity look-a-like? How about looks? How about personality? :-D yay for recycled questions!!, Yay indeedo! Can I be boring and say I don't have a clue? lol. Who would you think I resemble? :) Personality wise  I can't really say either  only because I don't think celebrities are in the spotlight enough to see their true personalities. A bit of a crap question to ask you wasn't it really? :(,Positive
9926,Who named you?, My dad did actually.  My mum named my sister  Charlotte so it was my dad's turn to name me. If they went with my mums choice  I would have been called 'Emily'. Quite funny considering I AM EMILY when it comes to Skins and relating to her character lol :P,Positive
9927,Who told you they loved you last?, Carla Price...precisley 2 hours ago ;),Positive
9928,Who was the last person you said I love you to?, ERmmm  probably a friend :),Positive

They do my head in! Why do people constantly feel the need to ring you up and put you onto a machine the other end? Thats what a phone is for :S Its different if you ring them and get a machine  but the other way around? Psssssh! Its like my voicemail calling you :S,Positive
9930,Who would you cast to play you in a movie?, probably Drew Barrymore  only because she comes across very much as the sweet and innocent girl  which a shy side  a geeky side and a dorky idiot. Which I think I have elements of :/,Positive
9931,who would you never want to meet?, Hmmm  can I say re-meet? the girl who bullied me at school. Because it would result in name calling ;) lol!,Positive
9932,WHO'S BETTER LOOKS && SINGING WISE: BEYONCE OR TAYLOR SWIFT ?, Singing wise  there isnt even a choice. I think Beyonce is very natural looking  but I would say  personally  Taylor Swift. Beyonce is the GOD of singing voices :),Positive
9933,Who's the funniest person you know?, You ;);),Positive
9934,Who's the most underrated actor?, Without doubt  Lily Loveless,Positive
9935,who's your best ship?, Ummmm  no idea :S,Positive

9937,Wht do you ship me and Louise?, Why?! You need me to answer that?! Once you sort out your sexuality (and Louise for that matter) you both are totally on ;),Positive
9938,Whuts the deal with Chicken McNuggets? What part of the chicken are these things from?, I think they come from all over the chickens body. Head  legs  claws  eyes  beak  and perhaps a tiny bit of the breast?  Altogether  IT TASTES GOOOOD ;) Only joking  I don't like fast food  probably because there isn't enough chicken heads in there. Just saying...,Positive
9939,Why are Softballs hard?, Because thats how you win. Didn't you know? They call it softball to attract all the girls  then you hit them in the head  and BINGO! You have a free court ;),Positive
9940,Why are there flotation devices under plane seats instead of parachutes?, HAHA! I think someone should devise a thing where both are built in one. Do you reckon? Hmmm  might be onto something there  there could be money in this ;),Positive
9941,Why are there seeds in seeded grapes  but no bones in a boned fillet? hmmm..., I would totally never buy a boned fillet if that was the case.. I can see the headlines now &quot;Anyone for chicken bone? Anyone for chicken bone? Oh yes  and the little bit of meat that surrounds it...&quot;,Positive
9942,Why are they called stairs inside but steps outside?, De de de dahh de doooo *pretends I am not asked a question that stumps me* la la le loooo...,Positive
9943,Why are you so cute?, I am? :/,Positive
9944,Why are your teeth so awesome?!, My teeth are awesome? You think? Or was that sarcasm? lol Thanks  I just maintain them  and take regular visits to the dentist. Up to now (touch wood)  I have never had any treatment or fillings in my teeth  so I must be doing something right :),Positive
9945,Why aren't you out tonight? =O, I would have liked to  but stupid bad ass meeting in work  rather early I might add :'( WHY AREN'T YOU?! :P lol,Positive
9946,Why didnt you answer your phone?, My phone never rings :S If you mean today  I was preoccupied :P,Positive
9947,Why do banks leave the door wide open but the pens chained to the counter?, Because we aren't property of the bank  whereas the pens were hired as slaves to use...,Positive
9948,Why do companies offer you free gifts? Aren't gifts by definition free?, Because it draws the spectator in....then...&quot;RARRRRRR! GOT YOU&quot; &quot;...bollocks...&quot; You have to do whatever they say now. You are under their spell. Kind of like a prostitute  but no sex or money...,Positive
9949,Why do most cars have speedometers that go up to at least 130 when you legally can't go that fast on any road? soooo not needed..., Thats for off road racing  aka track racing :P Well I dunno  perhaps? Or its a guide for your enemies? &quot;You hate them this much  hit them at this speed...&quot; etc ;),Positive
9950,Why do people more commonly skip breakfast than any other meal  considering that this is the time when the stomach is emptiest?, Well  I for one  never really feel that hungry when I wake up. I sleep at odd times (because of my insomnia) so when I get up  I normally wait until about 2ish and have a bit of toast which lasts me for breakfast and lunch. Here's my theory. When you get hungry  if you don't actually eat anything  after a while you start to go past it  and I for one  lose my appetite altogether. So here's my thinking. You are asleep overnight  thus losing your appetite whist you are asleep  then waking up having gone past it  and are no longer hunger? What do you think?,Positive
9951,Why do people say  You can't have your cake and eat it too? Why would someone get cake if they can't eat it? :-?, Because thats just plain greedy!!! If you are given the cake  thats one out of 2. If there is no one else there  then fine  you can eat it too. If someone else is there though  tough shit. You had your half  now you need to let someone else eat it :P,Positive
9952,Why do they call it getting your dog fixed if afterwards it doesn't work anymore? hahahah ;-), &quot;getting your dog fixed&quot;? I haven't even heard that before lol.,Positive
9953,Why do we never hear of people coming from u2018left westu2019 or u2018right eastu2019  only 'down south' and 'up north'?, HAHAHAHAHA!!!! I think you should ask that to Obama  if he doesn't have a good enough reason  he may post it in his speeches ;),Positive
9954,Why do you come on formspring?, Cure for boredom :) Its not like anyone is really interested  but hey :),Positive
9955,Why do you hate hockey so much?, I don't hate hockey  at all  I just can't stay watching that little puck bounce about when I keep loosing it. It's all about finding the right distractions :P,Positive
9956,why do you love formspring? do you love formspring? do you love the anonymity of it?, Formspring  yeah I do love the anonymity of it. You can ask someone something  without actually asking them directly. So  it can save that awkward &quot;Why?&quot; moment that everyone dreads :P Formspring makes you question things  and I don't just mean that in the literal sense  it makes you question things about yourself  and as a result  you can find out things you didn't even know were there. Its informing :),Positive
9957,Why does mineral water that has trickled through mountains for centuries go out of date next year?... and yes... i read the side information on water bottles... anything can amuse me ;-), Because its contained inside a bottle? There is no oxygen getting to it? Ermmmmm  dunno lol. Its cute  continue :),Positive
9958,Why does u2018dyslexiau2019 have to be so hard to spell?, Its a trick. If you can't spell in  FAILLL>>> Into &quot;special needs&quot; class at school  while the rest of the teachers smoke weed...lol,Positive
9959,Why don't sheep shrink in the rain?, HAHAHAHA! Wow! I love you for this comment! Thats hilarious! <3333,Positive
9960,Why is Charlie short for Charles if they are both the same number of letters?, Because Charlie is also short for charlotte  and time for a story I think...  Once upon a time  there was a young girl called Charlotte. She was a pretty little girl  and everyone loved her. only one problem is  she had a great love for sports and all things male. She came out to her parents as being gay  and they wouldn't tolerate such a thing! So  they sent her to the nearby hospital and attached...pieces  and removed....bits.  She comes out  or is it still a she? His parents decided to cure the 'gay' issue  by changing her into a boy. Her former name  Charlotte had to be changed  and by rule of easiness  they changed it to Charles  so her former nickname would still be of use (they didn't want to change her name again  costing them more by deed poll). Charlie lived happily ever after  marrying the woman of his dreams... The end :),Positive
9961,Why is an alarm clock going off when it actually turns on?, Hmmm  I had SO many questions if &quot;turning on&quot; wasn't to do with Alarm Clocks. But I think you have me there...such a shame ;),Positive
9962,Why is an electrical outlet called an outlet when you plug things into it? Shouldn't it be called an inlet., Because it pushes the power out? I feel you are trying to catch me out here missy :P,Positive
9963,Why is Greenland called green when it is covered in ice? And Iceland is called ice when its got more green?...?????, I think someone was probably holding the map upside down when they named the places :(,Positive
9964,Why is it called a drive through if you have to stop?, Ohhh you don't! You just drive with your hand out the window  and GRABBBB! Stopping is for oldies ;),Positive
9965,Why is it called tourist season if we can't shoot at them?, I don't think I get this one either. Thats an epic fail...whats wrong with me today? :S,Positive
9966,Why is it only drug dealers and software developers call their clients 'users'?, I didn't know that drug dealers called their clients users? Or is that some joke that im not getting? lol Also ho's call their clients users ;),Positive
9967,Why is it so hard to let go? To go with the flow and not be in control of everything., Because when you aren't in control  anything can happen  and thats rather scary. Things can look up  or things can go to shit. Having that sense of control  at least gives you a grip on the car while it is moving...,Positive
9968,Why is it that people say they slept like a baby when babies wake up  like  every two hours?, Because babies actually sleep really well :) Its humans that are the problem. The babies are asleep  BUT because the parents are driven insane by constant 'baby-like' things  they hallucinate and THINK the baby is up. As a matter of fact  its still sleeping. I think its parents with the issues  never children...,Positive
9969,Why is it that when things get wet they get darker  even though water is clear? :-), Hmmm  good question. Never thought about that before. Perhaps because when we look at things through water  because of magnification  things appear closer and/or a different shape (eg a pencil appears bent). The magnification and density of the water  fragments the light thus giving it a different appearance or colour? I don't know  just a suggestion lol,Positive
9970,Why is it that when you're driving and looking for and address you turn the radio down?, Concentration dude! You will understand when you eventually drive :P The music can be pretty distracting  so its a way of making sure you actually find the place :P I don't know if it helps mind you...,Positive
9971,Why is my form so empty? =[, Your form? Why? :( You just dont have the friends that I have  and I think thats probably a good thing lol,Positive
9972,Why is the 0 on a phone after 1 and not before 1?, Because its thinner  and they thought  &quot;if we start with the thinner numbers  we will know how much space we have to make the fatter ones&quot;. Thats why the 0 isn't like a O. Its more squashed  because they were losing space.,Positive
9973,Why is u2018abbreviationu2019 such a long word? haha :-P, Its to emphasis the point of an abbreviation :P By using the word  it makes you want to do it... see ;) Its self publicity lol :P,Positive
9974,why would i spy on you?... well the reasons are endless.. but if were to ba a good spy  i couldnt reveal why  now could i? haha sadly enough  you'll never know! ;-), Its such a shame. I thought I was special  knowing you were just 'doing your job'  its heartbreaking ;),Positive
9975,Will you make me some dinner?, I just made myself some  but you can share if you like :),Positive
9976,wisdom or beauty?, Hmm  im going to be awkward and say both ;) because you can be beautiful and learn to be a wiser person  but there is no past being ugly lol.,Positive
9977,Worst thing someone has ever done to you?, Ummm  its hard to pin point things. I don't really know if im honest. I get walked over A LOT by people  so I suppose just being taken advantage of.  Sometimes I do things for people (family  friends etc) and I don't really feel gratitude for it. So I suppose  putting in loads of effort to something  and it not being appreciated is a slap in the face :(,Positive
9978,Would she ever doubt the way i feel about her in my heart? If tomorrow never comes  will she know how much I loved her ? Did I try in everyway  to show her every day? She's my only one., Retro songageeeeeeeeee...,Positive
9979,would u kiss me if u know me ?, Well do you want to kiss me? Its sweet if you do :) But of course  kissing someone depends on if I had feelings for them. If I didn't know who they were  I can't say whether I would kiss them or now. Best come clean ;) lol  then I would tell you my answer :),Positive
9980,would you bring me flowers in the pouring rain? would you forever paint flowers for me   when i see you face would i know i've made it home?, I have no clue where thats from  but I just googled it  and it came up with &quot;emo lyrics&quot;! HAHA! You got your answer ;),Positive
9981,Would you buy me dinner if I had no money and no food?, Of course. Sharing is good  sharing is nice  sharing solves all. Unless you are Cook/Freddie ;),Positive
9982,would you change your (last) name if you got married?  would you rather that your partner changed her (last) name? or keep things the same?, This is annoying it didn't appear :( How many others aren't appearing too :'( Anyway  to re-answer :) I think its quite sad when you change your name  only because I see it (kind of) as a way that you are giving up on your family and ditching them for a new one. BUT  I also see it as a wonderful way  when you gain someone elses name  because you are being accepted into your loved ones family  and thats awesome <3 So to solve all  I actually like double barreled names :) You don't give up your own  but you still gain your loved ones. Its like bringing both families together  rather than dropping or gaining  you get both :) How about you?,Positive
9983,would you change your name if you got married? would you rather your partner changed their name? or keep everything the same?, I do like the idea of a double barreled name actually. Losing your name  is probably quite sad  but there again  changing your name is really really exciting  knowing you are part of the family of your loved one. So a combination of both  bringing both families together :) What do you think?,Positive
9984,would you dance  if i asked you to dance?, Depends on how much alcohol was involved :P,Positive
9985,,,Positive
9986,Would you dribble  if i touched your lip?, Only if I had recently been to the dentist.,Positive
9987,would you ever come visit me?, I actually would yes :D I would love to in fact! There are a lot of issues with cost and time though. Would you ever visit me? :P,Positive
9988,Would you ever date someone who was  I don't know 16?, Depends on the person  I can see where you are going with this ;),Positive
9989,would you ever do MDMA with a 16 year old?, LOL!!! Depends if the 16 year old was present IF I were to do MDMA :P,Positive
9990,Would you ever eat 18 banana's in the space of 5days?, Ummm no. Talk about Potassium overload :S,Positive
9991,Would you ever get with say  a 16year old from leicester?, haha! Depends on how sober I am ;);) (heavily going to regret that answer),Positive
9992,,,Positive
9993,Would you ever meet someone from online just for sex?, NO. All in all. Just  no!,Positive
9994,Would you give your life to save someone else's?, It depends on the person. If it was my enemy who just murdered my best friend...im staying put lol. If it was someone who I loved with all my heart  I couldn't bare to see them be killed  so yes I would. Without hesitation  because if I lived  and they didn't  my life would have less meaning  knowing they should be here and not myself. Sorry to go on a downer there  I just watched Freddies ep  what do you expect :P,Positive
9995,Would you have a u2018Happy Buttonu2019 installed on your body  connected to your brain  which would instantly make you very happy whenever you pressed it?, OH HELL YES!!! That would be AWESOME! Imagine how many people you could affect with your happiness? :D,Positive
9996,would you kiss me?, It depends on who you were :P I don't go around giving out free kisses you know ;) lol,Positive
9997,Would you like a big blackr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r CURRANT?, Next question O_O,Positive
9998,would you like me to help you tidy up??? i love cleaning and organizing... and yep  i know im weird :-p, Thanks! Well  I just finished BUT its probably going to get messy again. So  you are welcome to pop around and wait until it gets messy again ;),Positive
9999,Would you like to know the day youu2019re going to die ahead of time? Why or why not?, I would yeah. Even though that would be TERRIFYING to know  but if there was no way I could prevent it from happening  then I would like to make sure I spend it with the people that I love. I couldn't bare dying when there are people who don't know how much I care about them. Its an important issue to me  which is why I always try to tell people  as much as possible how much I care. You never know when something could happen right? So its best to make sure you do the things that you really would need to before something happened :( Morbid! lol,Positive
10000,Would you live in a different country? If yes  which one and why?, I would like to live in some parts of America yes. Only because its CHEAPER THAN HERE  the people seem more friendly than here  its hotter (in certain parts) and what can I sayyy? Everyone loves the USA :),Positive
10001,would you not do the devil then ? THATS OFFENSIVE!, The devil is hot. SMOKINNNN'!!!!,Positive
10002,Would you prefer if good things happened  or interesting things?, Good things :) Because good things can be interesting things too  depending on how you look at them. BUT interesting things  can be bad things  and that sucks :( So good things :) Besides  they make you happy  and you can never have enough 'goodness' :D,Positive
10003,Would you rather be good looking or rich?, Good Looking I think. Just because being rich can attract the wrong crowd all together! I wouldn't want to be popular because of my money and I know there are crowds that are drawn to that. I would rather be popular for being me  and being good looking certainly adds to that. There was something on the TV I watched once  and they said that better looking people are more likely to be employed for a job than uglier ones. This is because  when they see someone who is attractive in how they dress  hair etc  it shows they are self caring and someone who doesn't take much effort in their appearance  could show that they aren't willing to give much effort in that field of work. It was scientifically proven  but I think its bullshit really lol  or should be at least :),Positive
10004,Would you rather fall up or down the stairs? (yes it is possible to fall up the stairs), Fall up the stairs  because at least you don't end up in a weird position on the floor :P You would end up lying on the stairs  feet first  so it protects your dignity if wearing a skirt ;) lol,Positive
10005,Would you rather see a movie at the theater or at home on DVD? Why?, Hmmmm  it completely depends on the movie. Some things that come out and I REALLLLLLLLLLY want to see  then definitely cinema  just to get the whole interpretation right  eg sound  big screen  atmosphere etc. But  if its something that Im not too worried about  but I would still like to watch it. I would probably buy it on DVD and cuddle up in the comfort of my own home :) It does completely depend on the movie though  and the people I was to watch it with ;),Positive
10006,would you rather someone paint you a picture or write you a poem?, Hmmmm  it depends on how much effort they had to put into each of them. I mean  if someone was an artist and they painted me a picture  it wouldn't mean so much if say a writer painted me a picture. Or vice versa  if a writer wrote me a poem or an artist wrote me a poem  that one would mean more. Its all about which one took the most effort and concentration to do  you know what I mean? :D,Positive
10007,Would you rather spend life in prison or be executed?, Probably prison. Prisons today are actually getting better :) I mean  say you didn't have any money  and it meant you were going to be living on the streets  and homeless for however long that took. I would go and commit a crime that enabled me to go to prison. Nothing to hurt anyone  but perhaps a robbery or something where I intended on getting caught lol. It has to be better in there than living on the streets. Anyway  this wasn't the question....Prison. Just because  I don't think it is that bad in there. I mean yeah  I can't really know  not properly  but aside from being beaten up (perhaps) it can't be too bad. Better than being dead lol. If not  then just try something and kill yourself :S lol!,Positive
10008,Would you rather spend the rest of your life without a significant other  or would you rather have a partner who is extremely difficult?, Partner who is extremely difficult. Just because  living alone  its going to leave you depressed anyway  no one truly likes to live alone. So at least  someone who could be difficult  at least they would make you feel something. Even if one minute it was passion  the next anger  its better to feel something over nothing. I would choose the harder option  because no one deserves to be alone :),Positive
10009,Would you rather try skeleton or luge?, Can't I just be the person at the bottom who moves the foam about?,Positive
10010,would you really come visit me? :-), Of course I would! :) You're not far from New York right? I think I should visit  and we both go to New York together :) A lot of traveling America I don't like to do because of long plane journeys but New York is about 7 hours going and 5.5 coming back  so thats GOOOOOD! :D  You're about an hour away from New York right? I may have googled it ;) lol,Positive
10011,would you say im a goth  or Jesus?, I would say you are Louise. Whatever that means.,Positive
10012,would you say that a Jaffa cake is a buscuit?, A biscuit? Ummm  yeah :) A nice one though! XD,Positive
10013,Wow  i dont like peppers or fish so ill just have some pasta :), hmm  Pasta and salt. Sounds incredibly lovely :/ I shall eat around the pasta at the edges then  and post the rest to you. Cool?,Positive

I like to please other people  and when I see someone else's face light up at something I have done  its just the best feeling!!!! <33333 BUT  to receive is also an important part of the relationship.

I would want everyone to be around them and there for them  just incase they morn ;) I WOULD BE TERRIFIED! Umm  what I would do?

10037,You can have one of the following two things: trust or love... pick..., Well for me  true love comprises of Trust. You can never let yourself love someone fully if you don't trust them. So  Love :),Positive

10071,your Certificates-which takes 2 years to get  Masters-another 2 years  and PhD/Doctoral-another 2 years.. :-)people typically start college at age 18 and are done college by age 22 but then there is grad-school..so yea..loads of stuff  haha its so weird, HAHA! Yeah  we start college at 16  and then finish at 18  to go to university and usually come out about 21/22 with your degree depending on what you major in. Most degrees are 3 years  but if you wanted to be a Vet or a Doctor or a Surgeon etc  its about 6/7 years. Completely depends on the course :) The course im doing in september  basically gives me the equivilent of a degree  but in one year. Then I have the access to continue for another year  (making it a total of 2) to gain a masters in motion picture production  and the area I specialised in. So  Film School can definitely be a quicker route through education  but it is a lot more intense.,Positive
10072,Your closest friend?, Probably Carla Price  because I think she knows pretty much everything about me.,Positive
10073,your more of a cat person  aren't you? personally im more of a dog person  myself..., I actually prefer dogs  but I only have cats because of my sister.

10077,Your worst enemy?, Hmmm  I don't think I really have enemies as such. People I don't wish to communicate with  I don't. Simple as :) So  me talking to you  it means I would at least like you. GO YOU :D,Positive
